<small>A CHANCE ENCOUNTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two boys alighted from a surface car in front
of the big Terminal in New York and dodged
their way between dashing taxicabs, honking
motor cars and plunging horses to the safety of the
broad sidewalk. Each boy carried a suitcase, and
each suitcase held, amongst the more or less obliterated
labels adorning it, a lozenge-shaped paster of
gray paper, bearing, in scarlet, the letters “G. S.,”
cunningly angulated to fit the space of the rhombus.</p>

<p>If I were Mr. Sherlock Holmes I should write, as
a companion work to the famous monograph on
tobacco ashes, a Treatise on the Deduction of Evidence
from Hand Luggage. For one can learn a
great deal from a careful scrutiny of, say, a suitcase
or kit bag. As for example. Here is one bearing
the initials “D. H. B.” on its end. It is quite an
ordinary affair, costing when new in the neighborhood
of six dollars perhaps. Its color has deepened
to a light shade of mahogany, from which we
deduce that its age is about three years. While it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
still in good usable condition, it is not a bit “swagger,”
and we reach the conclusion that its owner is
in moderate circumstances. There are no signs of
abuse and so it is apparent that the boy is of a careful
as well as a frugal turn of mind. A baggage tag
tied to the handle presumably bears name and
address. Therefore he possesses forethought. The
letters “D. H. B.” probably stand for David H.
Brown. Or possibly Daniel may be the first name.
We select David as being more common. As to the
last name, we frankly own that we may be mistaken,
but Brown is as likely as any other. The letters
“G. S.” on the label indicate that he belongs to some
Society, but the G puzzles us. It might stand for
Gaelic or Gallic—or Garlic—but we’ll let that go
for the moment and look at the other bag.</p>

<p>This bears the initials “J. T. L.,” not in plain
block letters but in Old English characters. It is of
approximately the same age as the first one, but cost
nearly twice as much, and has seen twice as much use
and more than twice as much abuse. The handle is
nearly off and those spots suggest rain. There is no
tag on it. The initials probably stand for John T.
Long. The gray label with the scarlet letters indicate
that the owner of the suitcase is also a member
of the mysterious Society. Other facts show that he
is wealthy, careless, not over-neat, fond of show
and lacks forethought. There!</p>

<p>And just at this moment “J. T. L.” lays a detaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
hand on his companion’s arm and exclaims:
“Wait a shake, Dud!” And we begin to lose faith
in our powers of deduction and to fear that we will
never rival Mr. Holmes after all!</p>

<p>Dud—his full name, not to make a secret of it any
longer, was Dudley Henry Baker—paused as requested,
thereby bringing down upon him the ire of
a stout gentleman colliding with the suitcase, and
followed his friend’s gaze. A few yards away, in a
corner of the station entrance, two newsboys were
quarreling. Or so it seemed at first glance. A
second look showed that one boy, much larger and
older than his opponent, was quarreling and that
the other was trying vainly to escape. The larger
boy had the smaller youth’s arm in a merciless grip
and was twisting it brutally, eliciting sharp cries of
pain from his victim. The passing throng looked,
smiled or frowned and hurried by.</p>

<p>“The brute!” cried Dud indignantly, and started
across the pavement, his companion following with
the light of battle in his eyes. But the pleasure of
intercession was not to be theirs, for before they had
covered half the distance a third actor entered the
little drama. He was a sizable youth of about their
own age, and he set the bag he carried down on the
ledge of the step beside him, stuffed a morning paper
in his pocket, seized hold of the larger boy with his
left hand, placed his right palm under the boy’s chin
and pushed abruptly backward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Needless to say, the smaller boy found himself
free instantly. The bully, staggering away, glared
at his new adversary and rushed for him, uttering an
uncomplimentary remark. The new actor in the
drama waited, ducked, closed, crooked a leg behind
the bully and heaved. The bully shot across the
sidewalk until his flight was interrupted by the nearest
pedestrian and then, his fall slightly broken by
that startled and indignant passer, measured his
length on the ground. At the same instant a commotion
ensued near the curb and the rescued newsboy
sensing the reason for it, exclaimed: “Beat it,
feller! The cop’s coming!” and slid through the
nearest door. His benefactor acted almost as
quickly, and when the policeman finally pushed his
way to the scene he found only a dazed bully and
an irate pedestrian as a nucleus for the quickly-forming
crowd.</p>

<p>Dud and his companion, grinning delightedly, followed
the youth with the bag. The newsboy had
utterly vanished, but his rescuer was a few yards
away, crossing the waiting-room. On the impulse
Dud and his companion hurried their steps and drew
alongside him, the latter exclaiming admiringly:
“Good for you, old man! That was a peach of a
fall!”</p>

<p>The other turned, showing no surprise, and smiled
slowly and genially. “Hello,” he responded. “What
did you remark, Harold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“I said that was a peach of a fall.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Were you there? I guess we’d have had
some real fun if the cops hadn’t butted in. Is this
the way to the trains, Harold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but my name isn’t Harold,” answered the
other, slightly exasperated. “What train do you
want?”</p>

<p>The boy observed the questioner reflectively for a
moment. Then: “What trains have you got?” he
inquired politely.</p>

<p>“Come on, Jimmy,” said Dud, tugging at his
friend’s sleeve. “He’s too fresh.”</p>

<p>“Thought you might be a stranger, and I was trying
to help you,” said James Townsend Logan stiffly.
“You find your own train, will you?”</p>

<p>They had emerged into the concourse now and
the stranger stopped and put his bag down, facing
Jimmy with a quizzical smile. “I guess you’re an
artist,” he said. “Making believe to get mad would
fool most any fellow. What is it now? Eskimo
Twins? Or——”</p>

<p>“That’ll be about all for you!” said Jimmy hotly.
“If I’m an Eskimo you’re——”</p>

<p>“Back up, Harold! You don’t savvy. Far be it
from me to take a chance on your nationality——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” growled Jimmy, turning away.</p>

<p>“Well, but you’re not going, are you?” called the
stranger in surprised tones. Jimmy <em>was</em> going, and
Dud was going with him. And on the way to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
gate they exchanged short but succinct verdicts on
the youth behind.</p>

<p>“Flip kid!” sputtered Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Crazy!” said Dud, disgustedly.</p>

<p>The subject of the uncomplimentary remarks had
watched them amusedly as long as they were in sight.
Outraged dignity spoke eloquently from Jimmy
Townsend’s back. When the two boys were hidden
by the throng about the gate the stranger chuckled
softly, took up his bag again and moved toward a
ticket window. He had a long, easy stride, and the
upper part of his body, in spite of the heavy kit-bag
he carried, swung freely, giving the idea that
he was used to much walking and in less crowded
spaces.</p>

<p>“One of your very best tickets to Greenbank,
please,” he said to the man behind the window.</p>

<p>“Any special Greenbank?” asked the latter, faintly
sarcastic.</p>

<p>“Which one would you advise?”</p>

<p>The man shot an appraising look at the boy,
smiled, pulled a slip of cardboard from a rack,
stamped it and pushed it across the ledge. “Two-sixty-eight,
please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. You think I’ll like this one?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t, bring it back and I’ll change it.”</p>

<p>“That’s fair. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>At the news-stand he selected two magazines, paid
for them and then glanced at the clock. Twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
minutes past eleven exactly. He drew a watch from
his pocket and compared it with the clock. “Is that
clock about right?” he asked the youth behind the
counter.</p>

<p>“Just right,” was the crisp reply.</p>

<p>“Honest? I make it three minutes slow.” He
held his own timepiece up in evidence. The youth
smiled ironically.</p>

<p>“Better speak to the President about it,” he advised.
“He just set that clock this morning.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he be too busy to see me?” asked the
other doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Naw, he never does nothin’! He’d be glad to
know about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I think he ought to know. I guess
he wouldn’t want folks to be too early and miss their
trains!” He smiled politely and moved away, leaving
the news-stand youth to smile derisively and
murmur: “Dippy Dick!”</p>

<p>The sign “Information” above a booth in the center
of the concourse met his gaze and he turned his
steps toward it. “Will you please give me a timetable
showing the train service between New York
and Greenbank?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>“Greenbank, where?” demanded the official
bruskly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Come on! Greenbank, Connecticut? Greenbank,
Rhode Island? Greenbank——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“Which do you consider the nicest?” asked the
boy anxiously.</p>

<p>“Now, look here! I haven’t got time to fool
away. Find out where you want to go first.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry! I saw it said ‘Information’ here
and thought I’d get a little. If I’m at the wrong
window——”</p>

<p>“This is the Information Bureau, son, but I’m no
mind reader. If you don’t know which Greenbank
you want—Yes, Madam, eleven-thirty-two: Track
12!”</p>

<p>“Maybe this ticket will tell,” hazarded the boy,
laying it on the ledge. The man seized it impatiently.</p>

<p>“Of course it tells! Here you are!” He tossed a
folder across. “You oughtn’t to travel alone, son,”
he added pityingly.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I hope I shan’t have to. There’ll be
other people on the train, won’t there?”</p>

<p>“If there aren’t—Yes, sir, Stamford at twelve,
sir—you’d better put yourself in charge of the conductor!”</p>

<p>“I shall,” the other assured him earnestly. “Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“Just plain nutty, I guess,” thought the man, looking
after him.</p>

<p>Eleven-twenty-four now, and the boy approached
the gate, holding his bag in front of him with both
hands so that it bumped at every step and fixing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
eyes on the announcement board, his mouth open
vacuously.</p>

<p>“Look where you’re going!” exclaimed a gentleman
with whom the boy collided.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Look where you’re going, I said! Stop bumping
me with your bag!”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>The gentleman pushed along, muttering angrily,
and the boy followed, his bag pressed against the
backs of the other’s immaculate gray trousered
knees. “Greenbank, Mister?” he inquired of the
man at the gate.</p>

<p>“Yes. Ticket, please!”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Let me see your ticket.”</p>

<p>“Ticket?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, your railway ticket! Come on, come
on!”</p>

<p>“I got me one,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, let me see it! Hurry, please! You’re
keeping others back.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.” The boy set down his bag and began
to dig into various pockets. The ticket examiner
watched impatiently a moment while protests from
those behind became audible. Finally:</p>

<p>“Here, shove that bag aside and let these folks
past,” said the man irascibly. “Did you buy your
ticket?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“I say, did you buy your ticket?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh, I got me one, Mister.”</p>

<p>“Well, find it then! And you’d better hurry if
you want this train!”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“I say, if you want this—Here, what’s that you’ve
got in your hand?”</p>

<p>“This?” The boy looked at the small piece of
cardboard in a puzzled manner. “Ain’t that it?”
he asked. But the man had already whisked it out
of his hand, and now he punched it quickly, thrust it
back to the boy and pushed him along through the
gate.</p>

<p>“Must be an idiot,” he growled to the next passenger.
“Someone ought to look after him.”</p>

<p>“All aboard!” shouted the conductor as the boy
with the bag swung his way along the platform. “All
aboard!”</p>

<p>“Is this the train for Greenbank?”</p>

<p>The conductor turned impatiently. “Yes. Get
aboard!”</p>

<p>“Pardon me?” The boy leaned nearer, a hand
cupped behind his ear.</p>

<p>“Yes! Greenbank! Get on!”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” smiled the other. “Would you
mind speaking a little louder?”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes, this is the Greenbank train!</em>” vociferated
the conductor. “<em>Get aboard!</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the boy with much dignity,
“but you needn’t shout at me. I’m not deaf!”
Whereupon he climbed leisurely up the steps of the
already moving train and entered a car.</p>

<small>THE BOY FROM OUT WEST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jimmy Logan and Dud Baker discussed the
eccentricities of the obnoxious youth they had
encountered in the waiting-room for several
minutes after they were seated in the train. (By
arriving a good ten minutes before leaving time they
had been able to take possession of two seats, turning
the front one over and occupying it with their
suitcases.)</p>

<p>“Know what I think?” asked Jimmy, his choler
having subsided. “Well, I think he was having fun
with us. There was a sort of twinkle in his eye,
Dud.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he was,” agreed the other. “He was a
nice-looking chap. And the way he lit into that big
bully of a newsboy was dandy!”</p>

<p>“Guess he knows something about wrestling,”
mused Jimmy. “Wish I did. Let’s you and I take
it up this winter, Dud.”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough for you. Seniors don’t
have anything to do. I’m going to be pretty busy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
though. Say, you don’t suppose that fellow is coming
to Grafton, do you?”</p>

<p>“If he is, he’s a new boy,” was the response.
“Maybe he’s a Greenie. A lot of Mount Morris fellows
go back this way. It’s good we got here early.
This car’s pretty nearly filled. I wish it would hurry
up and go. I’m getting hungry.”</p>

<p>“How soon can we have dinner?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“Twelve, I guess. They take on the diner down
the line somewhere. Got anything to read in your
bag?”</p>

<p>Dud opened his suitcase, lifted out several magazines
and offered them for inspection. He was a slim
boy of sixteen, or just short of sixteen, to be exact,
with very blue eyes, a fair complexion and good
features, rather a contrast to his companion who was
distinctly stocky, with wide shoulders and deep chest.
Jimmy’s features were a somewhat miscellaneous lot
and included a short nose, a wide, humorous mouth,
a resolutely square chin and light brown eyes. His
hair was reddish-brown and he wore it longer than
most fellows would have, suggesting that Jimmy
went in for football. Jimmy, however, did nothing
of the sort. In age he was Dud’s senior by four
months. Both boys wore blue serge suits, rubber-soled
tan shoes and straw hats, all of a style appropriate
to the time of year, which was the third week
in September. The straw hats were each encircled
by a scarlet-and-gray band, scarlet and gray being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
colors of Grafton School, to which place the two boys
were on their way after a fortnight spent together
at Jimmy’s home. The similarity of attire even extended
to the shirts, which were of light blue mercerized
linen, and to the watch-fobs, showing the school
seal, which dangled from trousers’ pockets. It ended,
however, at ties at one extreme and at socks at the
other, for Jimmy’s four-in-hand was of brilliant Yale
blue, and matched his hosiery, while Dud wore a
brown bow and brown stockings.</p>

<p>Jimmy turned over the magazines uninterestedly.
“Guess I’ve seen these,” he said, tossing them to the
opposite seat. “I’ll buy something when the boy
comes through. I wonder what the new room’s like,
Dud.”</p>

<p>“It’s bound to be better than the old one.
I’m sorry we didn’t get one on the top floor,
though.”</p>

<p>“Guess we were lucky to get into Lothrop at all.
That’s what comes of leading an upright life, Dud,
and standing in with Charley and faculty. Bet you a
lot of fellows got left this fall on their rooms. Gus
Weston has been trying for Lothrop two years.
Wonder if he made it. Hope so. Gus is a rattling
good sort, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you suppose he will be the regular
quarter-back this year?”</p>

<p>“Not unless Nick Blake breaks his neck or something.
Gus will give him a good run for it, though.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Still, Bert Winslow and Nick are great friends, and
I guess Nick will naturally have the call.”</p>

<p>“Winslow never struck me as a fellow who would
play a favorite,” objected Dud.</p>

<p>“Of course not, but if you’re football captain and
there are two fellows who play about the same sort
of game, and one is a particular friend and the other
isn’t, and——”</p>

<p>“Here we go,” interrupted Dud as the conductor’s
warning reached them through the open window.</p>

<p>“Good work! That’s what I meant, you see.
Bert will naturally favor Nick. No reason why he
shouldn’t. Besides, Nick was quarter last year and
he was a peach, too. Bet you we have a corking
team this fall, Dud. Look at the fellows we’ve got
left over! Nick and Bert and Hobo and
Musgrave——”</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Dud in a low voice, nudging
his companion. The train had begun to move. Following
the direction of Dud’s gaze, Jimmy’s eyes fell
on the form of the boy he had accosted in the station.
The latter was coming leisurely down the car aisle,
looking on each side for a seat. But the weather
was warm and the passengers who were so fortunate
as to be sitting alone were loathe to share their accommodations.
The newcomer, however, displayed
neither concern nor embarrassment. Something
about him said very plainly that if he didn’t take this
seat or that it was only because he chose not to, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
not because he was intimidated by scowls or chilly
glances.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” began Dud, looking about the car,
“we’d ought to turn this over, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>But before Jimmy had time to answer the boy had
paused in his progress along the aisle and was smiling
genially down on them.</p>

<p>He was, first of all, an undeniably good-looking
youth. Even Jimmy was forced to acknowledge
that, although he did it grudgingly. In age he appeared
to be about sixteen, but he was tall for his
years and big in a well-proportioned way. He had
brown hair that was neither light nor dark, and eyebrows
and lashes several shades paler. His face
was rather long and terminated in a surprisingly
square chin. His brown eyes were deeply set and
looked out very directly from either side of a straight
nose. The mouth was a trifle too wide, perhaps, but
there was a pleasant curve to it, and at either end
hovered two small vertical clefts that were like elongated
dimples. Face, neck and hands were deeply
tanned. For the rest, he was square-shouldered,
narrow-waisted and deep-chested, and there was an
ease and freedom in his carriage and movements
that went well with the careless, self-confident look
of him.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows!” he said. “Mind if I sit here?”
Whereupon, and without waiting for reply, he lifted
Jimmy’s suitcase to the rack above, piled his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
bag on top of Dud’s and settled himself opposite the
latter. “Warm, isn’t it?” he observed, removing his
soft straw hat and putting it atop his bag. As he did
so his gaze traveled from Jimmy’s hat to Dud’s, and:
“Belong to the same Order, don’t you?” he said
affably. “Is it hard to get in?”</p>

<p>“School colors,” answered Dud stiffly.</p>

<p>“Oh! Thought maybe you were Grand Potentates
of the High and Mighty Order of Kangaroos
or something.”</p>

<p>“You’re chock full of compliments, aren’t you?”
asked Jimmy. “Called us Eskimos a few minutes
ago, I think.”</p>

<p>“No, you got that wrong, Harold. What I
meant——”</p>

<p>“Cut that out! My name isn’t Harold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. I couldn’t know, could I?” asked
the other innocently. “About the Eskimo Twins,
though. It’s like this. You see, this is my first visit
to your big and wicked city and the fellows out home
told me I’d surely be spotted by the confidence men.
Well, I’ve been in New York since yesterday afternoon
and not a blessed one of them’s been near me.
Made me feel downright lonesome, it did so! And
when you fellows came along I just naturally thought
someone was going to take a little notice of me at
last. You didn’t look like con men, but they say you
can’t tell by appearances. Sorry I made the mistake,
fellows. Dutch Haskell—he’s Sheriff out in Windlass—got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
to talking with a couple of nice-looking fellows
in Chicago once and they invited him to go and
see the Eskimo Twins, and Dutch fell for it and it
cost him four hundred dollars. That’s why I mentioned
the Twins. Wanted you fellows to know I
wasn’t as green as I looked, even if I did come from
the innocent west.”</p>

<p>“That’s rot,” said Jimmy severely. “You didn’t
mistake us for confidence men. You only pretended
to.”</p>

<p>Dud was secretly rather amused at Jimmy’s ruffled
temper. This breezy stranger was the first
person Dud had ever seen who was capable of causing
Jimmy to forget his highly developed sense of
humor.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the boy in the opposite seat,
smilingly, “I dare say you are a little too young for
a life of crime.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re not much younger than you are,”
replied Jimmy, with the suggestion of a sneer.</p>

<p>“No, about the same age, probably. I’m sixteen
and seven-eighths. Is there a parlor car on this
train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s about two cars forward,” answered
Dud.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s why I didn’t see it. Back home we
generally put them on the rear of the train.”</p>

<p>“You can find it easily enough,” said Jimmy meaningly.
“Don’t let us keep you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>The boy smiled amusedly. “Thanks, Harold, I
won’t. But I guess——”</p>

<p>Jimmy tried to stand up, but the confusion of legs
and a sudden lurch of the car defeated his purpose
and his protest lost effect. “Cut that out, Fresh!”
he said angrily. “You do it just once more and I’ll
punch your head.”</p>

<p>“My, but you fellows in the East are a hair-trigger
lot,” said the other, shaking his head sadly. “Maybe
you’d better tell me your name so I won’t get in
trouble. Mine’s Crail.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what it is,” growled Jimmy, observing
the other darkly. “You’re too flip.”</p>

<p>The boy opposite raised a broad and capable-looking
hand in front of him and observed it sorrowfully.
“Monty,” he said severely, “didn’t I tell
you before you left home you were to behave yourself?
Didn’t I?” The fingers crooked affirmatively.
“Sure I did! I told you folks where you were going
mightn’t understand your playful ways, didn’t I?”
Again the fingers agreed, in unison. “Well, then,
why don’t you act like a gentleman? Want folks to
think you aren’t more’n half broke?” The fingers
moved agitatedly from side to side. “You don’t?”
The fingers signaled “No!” earnestly. “Then you’d
better behave yourself, Monty,” concluded the boy
sternly. “No sense in getting in wrong right from
the start. Going to be good now?” The fingers
nodded vehemently, and the boy took the offending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
right hand in his left and placed it in his pocket.
“We’ll see,” he said, with intense dignity.</p>

<p>By that time Dud was laughing and the corners
of Jimmy’s mouth were trembling. The stranger
raised a pair of serious brown eyes to Jimmy as
he said gravely: “I have to be awfully strict with
him.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s mouth curved and a choking gurgle of
laughter broke forth. “Gee, you’re an awful fool,
aren’t you?” he chuckled. “Where do you come
from?”</p>

<p>The boy brought the offending hand from the
pocket and clasped it with its fellow about one knee
and leaned comfortably back. “Windlass City, Wyoming,
mostly,” he replied. “Sometimes I live in
Terre Haute.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Terre Haute?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“Indiana. Next door to Wyoming,” he answered
unblinkingly.</p>

<p>“No, we know better than that,” laughed Dud.
“Indiana’s just back of Ohio, and Wyoming’s away
out beyond Nebraska and Oklahoma and those
places. Do you live on a ranch?”</p>

<p>Crail shook his head. “No, there isn’t much
ranching up our way. It’s mostly mining. Snake
River district, you know. Windlass City’s about a
hundred miles northwest of Lander. Know where
the Tetons are? Or the Gros Ventre Range? We’re
in there, about ten miles from where Buffalo Fork<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and Snake River join. Some country, Har—I mean
friend.”</p>

<p>“Is it gold mining?” asked Jimmy interestedly.</p>

<p>“No, coal. That’s better than gold. There’s
more of it.”</p>

<p>“And you live there, Creel?”</p>

<p>“Crail’s the name. Only in summer. I’ve been
there pretty late, though. Winters I go back east to
Terre Haute. Last year I was at school, though.
Ever hear of Dunning Military Academy at Dunning,
Indiana?”</p>

<p>The boys shook their heads.</p>

<p>“It’s not so worse, but they teach you so much
soldiering that there isn’t much time for anything
else. And you have to live on schedule all day long,
and that gets tiresome. I kicked myself out last
May. Couldn’t stand it any longer.”</p>

<p>“Kicked yourself out?” echoed Dud questioningly.</p>

<p>“Yes, they wouldn’t do it so I had to. I tried
about everything I could think of, but the best they’d
do was to put me in the jug and feed me bread and
water. I spent so much time in ‘solitary’ that I got
so I liked it. It gives you a fine chance to think, and
I’m naturally of a very thoughtful disposition. Say,
I used to think perfectly wonderful thoughts in the
jug, thoughts that made a better boy of me!”</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned. “What did you do to get punished?”
he asked with lamentable eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“What little I could,” sighed Crail. “There wasn’t
much a fellow could do. You see, you’re dreadfully
confined. The last time I set a bucket of water outside
the commandant’s door and rang the fire gong.
He came out in a hurry and didn’t see the bucket and
put his foot in it. He was awfully peeved about it.
I told him he ought to blame his own awkwardness.”</p>

<p>“And they fired you then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they jugged me again. Six days that
time. Six days is the limit.”</p>

<p>“What did you do when they kicked you out?”
asked Dud.</p>

<p>“They didn’t kick me out. I gave them all the
chance in the world, but they wouldn’t part with me.
Stubborn lot of <em>hombres</em>. So I held a court martial
on myself one afternoon, found myself guilty of
gross disobedience and conduct unbecoming an officer
and a gentleman and sentenced myself to dishonorable
discharge. Then I wrote down the finding
of the court, tucked it under the commandant’s door
and mushed out of there. They came after me but
I doubled back, and swapped clothes with a fellow
I met on the road—he didn’t want to swap, but I
persuaded him to—and then walked back to Dunning
and took a train for home. Military academies
are all right for some fellows, but they irk me considerable.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going now?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“School. I told Jasper—Jasper’s my guardian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
since dad died—that I wanted to go to Mexico and
be an army scout or something, and he said an army
scout ought to know a heap more than I did and he
reckoned I’d better find me a school and go to it.
I thought maybe there was a heap in what he said
and decided I’d hike east here where learning comes
from. So here I am, Ha—fellows. I don’t know
what sort of a place this Mount Morris is, but I
don’t have to stay if I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Mount Morris!” exclaimed Dud and Jimmy in
one breath.</p>

<p>“Yes. Know it?”</p>

<p>They nodded.</p>

<p>“Aren’t going there yourselves, are you?” asked
Crail.</p>

<p>Jimmy snorted with disgust. “I should say not!
We’re Grafton fellows.”</p>

<p>“Are you? What’s Grafton, another school?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not ‘another’ school,” replied Jimmy
with great dignity. “It’s <em>the</em> school, the <em>only</em> school.”</p>

<p>“Think of that! Then this place I’m going to
doesn’t stack up very high, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mount Morris is all right,” replied Jimmy,
carelessly condescending, “if you aren’t particular.
A lot of fellows do go there.”</p>

<p>“Just like that, eh?” asked Crail, grinning.
“Well, aside from that it’s pretty good, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We naturally like Grafton a good deal better,”
said Dud seriously. “And I guess it really is better.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
But Mount Morris is good, too. That is so, isn’t it,
Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s good enough, I suppose,” answered Jimmy
without enthusiasm. “We generally manage to
beat it at about everything from chess to football,
and we have a lot more fellows, and better buildings
and better faculty, but it’s fair.”</p>

<p>“I savvy. This place you go to and Mount Morris
are rivals, eh? Play football together?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“And you fellows always win?”</p>

<p>“Well, not <em>always</em>,” granted Jimmy, “but pretty
generally. We won last year and——”</p>

<p>“First call for dinner in the dining car!” announced
a waiter, passing through the car. “Three
cars forward!”</p>

<p>“Me for that!” exclaimed Crail. “You fellows
eating?”</p>

<p>“You bet! I’m starved. Hurry up before the
seats are all gone.” Jimmy struggled heroically
and finally disentangled his legs and stood up. “Get
a move on, Dud! Maybe if we go now we can get
three seats together.”</p>

<small>MONTY CRAIL CHANGES HIS MIND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Three minutes later they were established at
a table and had ordered the first two courses,
oysters and soup, accompanied by such trifles
as celery and olives and mango pickles. They were
already consuming bread and butter with gusto, or,
at least, Jimmy and Dud were, for they had breakfasted
very early. Crail was less enthusiastic about
food, and while the others ate he took up the interrupted
subject of Mount Morris School.</p>

<p>“The way I came to know about this place was
seeing an advertisement in a magazine,” he confided.
“It certainly did read well, fellows. I sort of got
the idea that it was the leading educational institution
of the country. Maybe I was wrong, though.”</p>

<p>“You certainly were,” said Jimmy, speaking rather
indistinctly by reason of having his mouth very full.
“Mount Morris never led in anything. Why didn’t
you pick out a good school while you were picking?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s a mistake to believe all the advertisements
tell you,” said Crail. “Well, I guess it’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
be good enough for me. I’m not very particular. If
they give me enough to eat and treat me kindly and
beat a little algebra and history and a few languages
through my skull I won’t kick. Know whether I
have to take Latin, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Depends on what class you enter, I suppose,” replied
Dud, helping himself to Jimmy’s butter, to that
youth’s distress and muffled remonstrances. “I guess
you’ll have to take one year of it, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Snakes!” said Crail. “That’s sure disappointing.
I never did have any luck with Latin. Sort of a
half-baked language, I call it.” His sorrow was dispelled
by the appearance of the waiter with the
oysters, and he beamed approval and beckoned with
his fork. “Sam,” he said confidingly, “you bring in
six more of these little birds. I haven’t eaten a real
nice fresh oyster for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Can’t serve no more, sir,” replied the waiter.
“Only one order goes with a dinner.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Sam,” said Crail untroubledly.
“You don’t have to sing when you bring them in.
Just do it unostentatiously.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be did, sir. I’d like to oblige you,
but——”</p>

<p>“I know you would,” interrupted Crail earnestly.
“I just feel it, Sam. Say no more about it, but get
busy. And put them right here when you bring
them. Try for the plump ones, Sam. These look
sort of—sort of emaciated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t get them,” laughed Dud. “The
steward would take them away from him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get them all right,” was the reply. “Say,
fellows, they sure are good! I used to think I’d like
to live by the ocean and raise my own oysters. A
fellow could, eh?”</p>

<p>“Where do they find oysters?” inquired Jimmy.
“In the ocean or rivers or where?”</p>

<p>“Both,” said Dud. “They sow the young oysters
and——”</p>

<p>“Sow them!” exclaimed Jimmy. “Oh, sure! Just
like wheat or oats, I suppose. Where do you get
that stuff?”</p>

<p>“They do, don’t they, Creel?”</p>

<p>“It’s still Crail. Search me, though. I never saw
an oyster field. Ah, that’s the good old scout, Sam.
Place them right here and remove this devastated
affair.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’m sorry those wasn’t good, sir.” The
waiter uttered the regret loudly, evidently for the
benefit of the near-by diners, or, possibly, the eagle-eyed
steward.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t eat them, Sam,” replied Crail cheerfully.
“Don’t let it happen again.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Now what can I bring the rest of you
gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Do you always get what you want like that?”
inquired Jimmy enviously after the waiter had departed
with their order. “If I’d asked for a second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
helping of oysters they’d have thrown me off the
train!”</p>

<p>“The main thing to do,” answered Crail, holding
an oyster up on his fork and viewing it approvingly,
“is to think you’re going to get what you want and
let the other fellow know you think it. That gets
him to thinking so too, you see. How’s that soup?”</p>

<p>“Punk,” said Dud.</p>

<p>“I’ll pass it. Say, have you fellows got any
names?”</p>

<p>“A few,” replied Jimmy. “His is Baker and
mine’s Logan.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I was afraid I’d call you Harold again
and get beat up.” Crail didn’t look vastly alarmed,
however, and Jimmy secretly congratulated himself
on not having to carry out his threat of punching his
head. Crail didn’t quite look like a fellow who would
stand around idle during such a process! “I know
a fellow named Baker out in Wyoming. He’s foreman
on the Meeteetse Ranch. Might be kin to you,
eh? He comes from back here somewhere. I don’t
know what his first name is, though. He’s generally
called ‘Soapy.’ Any of your folks out my way?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” replied Dud. “Why do
they call him ‘Soapy’?”</p>

<p>“Search me! You get all kinds of names out
there. Up at the mines there’s a choice collection:
‘Pin Head’ Farrel, ‘Snub’ Thompson, ‘Tejon’ Burns,
‘Last Word’ MacTavish: a bunch of them. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
they sort of earn their names and sometimes
they just stumble on them, I guess. ‘Pin Head,’ he’s
a big, tall chap with a head six sizes too small for
him, and MacTavish is a Scotsman who is always
saying ‘If it’s my last wor-r-rd on airth!’ But I
don’t know why Thompson is called ‘Snub.’ Nor
where Burns gets his nickname.”</p>

<p>“What were you called?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“Just Monty. That’s my middle name, or part
of it. The whole of it’s Montfort. That was my
mother’s name. She was French.”</p>

<p>“What’s your first name?” Dud inquired.</p>

<p>“A.”</p>

<p>“A?”</p>

<p>“Yes, A Montfort Crail.”</p>

<p>“But—but doesn’t the A stand for anything?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. Snakes, fellows, if I eat all this
truck I’ll pass in my chips! Where’s this Grafter
School you tell about at?”</p>

<p>“Grafton, not Grafter, if you please. Grafters is
what the Greenies call us.”</p>

<p>“Who are the Greenies?”</p>

<p>“The Mount Morris fellows. Their color is
green, you know.”</p>

<p>“Seems like it would be a good place for me,”
chuckled Crail, transferring a large slice of roast
beef to his plate and starting to work on it. (The
others observed with interest as the meal progressed
that their new acquaintance dealt with one thing at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
a time. He consumed his beef to the last portion
before he paid any attention to the vegetables and
then ate each vegetable by itself.) “Which comes
first, Grafton or Greenbank?”</p>

<p>“Grafton, in everything,” laughed Dud. “We get
to Needham Junction about half-past two. That’s
where we change. You stay on and get to Greenbank
about an hour later.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it took so long,” said Crail. “Tell
me about your school, fellows. What’s it like?
What do you do there? How many of you are
there?”</p>

<p>“We had two hundred and sixteen last year,” replied
Jimmy, “and I guess we’ll have a few more this
year. I suppose the faculty would take more if we
had dormitory room. We have three big dormitories
and two small ones. Dud and I are in Lothrop
this year. That’s the newest one, and it’s a peach.
Then there’s Manning, where the younger fellows
live, and Trow, the oldest one. And there’s Fuller
and Morris, but they’re just wooden houses on the
Green. They look after about twenty fellows altogether.”</p>

<p>“Don’t any of you live around?” asked Crail. “In
the town, I mean?”</p>

<p>“No, the school’s about a half-mile from the town.
Of course, we have some fellows who live in Grafton,
you know, but not many.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’d rather live outside the school,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Crail. “You don’t have to toe the mark so much,
eh?”</p>

<p>“You won’t do that at Mount Morris,” said Dud,
“because you’re nowhere near the village there. The
school’s about three miles from Greenbank; and it’s
up-hill all the way, too. I know, for I walked it
once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve been there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dud grimly. “Last June. Jimmy
was with me. We got left at Webster and had
to foot it most of the way. We found a handcar
after awhile and did pretty well until a train came
sneaking up on us and we had to throw the handcar
down the bank. That was some journey, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled reflectively. “It certainly was!
And say, Crail, what do you suppose this idiot did
after we got to Greenbank? Well, he went in and
pitched three innings and won the game for us!”</p>

<p>“Good leather!” Crail viewed Dud with new interest.
“Pitched, eh? Say, that’s something I’d like
mighty well to do. I tried baseball at Dunning last
spring, but the captain and I had a falling-out and I
got fired.”</p>

<p>“What position did you play?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“First base—when I played. There was another
fellow, though, that had me beat. Football is what
I’m crazy about, though. What sort of a team do
you have at Grafton?”</p>

<p>“Good enough to win from Mount Morris two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
years out of three,” answered Jimmy. “We’ll have
a wonder this year, for we’ve got a lot of good men
left from last season. Do you play?”</p>

<p>“I tried it a little last fall,” answered Crail, “but
I didn’t make the team. I’d never seen football
near-to until then. I guess it takes a pile of learning,
that game. I’m sure fond of it, though, and I’m
going to try it again this time.”</p>

<p>“You ought to make good at it,” said Jimmy, running
an appreciative eye over Crail’s muscular body.
“Guard is your place, I guess.”</p>

<p>“They had me trying for tackle, but I’m heavier
now. I bought me a book about football and I’ve
been studying it. Say, there’s a lot to it, isn’t there?
Is it hard to get on the team at your school?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not if you show something,” answered
Jimmy. “Of course, there are a good many fellows
turn out every fall and you’ve got to work like an
Indian to make it, but——”</p>

<p>“Work like an Indian, eh?” laughed Crail. “Say,
did you ever see an Indian work? Well, I did, just
once. He was plowing a piece of ground about eight
times the size of this car and it took him three days
to do it. It’s Mrs. Indian who does the work, partner.
I guess I’d have to work a sight harder than
any Indian to get a place on a football team. But I
sure mean to do it, Har—I mean Logan. Sam,
I’ll have a dish of ice cream and a man-size cup of
coffee. Don’t fetch me one of those thimbles now!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
I suppose they make you study pretty hard, eh?”</p>

<p>“You bet they do!” said Jimmy feelingly. “And
then some!”</p>

<p>“Harder than at this place I’m headed for?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I guess about the same.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it costs more money at Grafton?”</p>

<p>“Tuition, you mean? That’s about the same, too,
I suppose. I don’t know how much it is at Mount
Morris, do you, Dud?”</p>

<p>Dud shook his head, but Crail supplied the information.
“A hundred and fifty,” he said. “Seventy-five
down and seventy-five in January. And
anywhere from two hundred to five hundred for
board and lodging. Education sure costs a heap of
money in this part of the world. I know a fellow
went through college in Nebraska, and it cost him
less than six hundred for the whole three years!”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty is the least you can pay
for a room at Grafton,” said Jimmy, “and that
means either Trow or one of the houses. But the
tuition is the same, except that we pay in three installments.”</p>

<p>“Well, I got two hundred and seventy dollars
with me,” said Crail, “and I guess that would see
me through for one term, eh? Only thing is, though,
will they let me in?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve taken an exam, haven’t you?”
asked Dud.</p>

<p>Crail shook his head. “No, they said at Mount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Morris that I could do that after I got there. Won’t
they let me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, only fellows usually enter by certificate
after the junior year. Let’s go back. We’ll be at
the Junction in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“What did you mean by entering by a certificate?”
asked Crail, when they were once more in
their seats in the day coach. “Where do you catch
these certificates?”</p>

<p>Dud explained and Crail frowned a moment.
Then his face cleared, and he laughed. “Well, I
guess they wouldn’t have given me any kind of a
certificate at Dunning that would have helped me
much, fellows! I’ll just have to go up against the
examination. Will it be hard, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” Jimmy reassured him.
“They’ll probably let you in, and then sock it to
you afterwards. I guess they want all the fellows
they can get at Mount Morris.”</p>

<p>“Mount Morris, yes, but how about this Grafton
place?” said Crail. “What about the examinations
there?”</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. “I never took them. Neither
did Dud. You’d be sure to pass for the lower
middle, though, if you failed for the upper. They
call them third and second at Mount Morris. We’d
better get our bags closed, Dud. There’s the
whistle.”</p>

<p>Crail arose and took his kit-bag out of the way,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
and set it in the aisle while Dud stuffed the magazines
back into his suitcase, and Jimmy rounded up
his own belongings. The train slowed down gradually,
and finally came to a stop, and a trainman
sent the stentorian cry of “Needham Junction!”
through the car. “Needham! Change here for
Grafton!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to have met you,” said Jimmy,
holding out his hand to Crail. “And if you ever
come to one of the games— Say, hold on! This
isn’t your station! You’ve got another hour yet,
Crail.”</p>

<p>But Crail, bag in hand, shook his head. “Fellows,
I’m plumb tired of traveling,” he said, “and
I sort of think I’ll get off right here.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll have three hours to wait, nearly!”
Jimmy expostulated to Crail’s broad back. “There
isn’t another train to Greenbank until five!”</p>

<p>Crail smiled over his shoulder as he pushed
through the car door.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve changed my mind about that place,” he
answered. “You see, I don’t know anybody at
Mount Morris, and I sort of like you fellows, and
I guess one school’s as good as another. Which
side do we get off at?”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“Do you really mean that you’re coming to Grafton?”
demanded Dud when they had reached
the station platform.</p>

<p>“If they’ll have me,” replied Crail, looking about
him curiously. “What do we do now? Take another
train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that one there. But—but——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Dud,” said Jimmy. “If he wants to,
what’s the difference? He isn’t bound to go to
Mount Morris if he doesn’t want to, is he? He
isn’t entered there, you idiot. Come on, Crail.
Talk about your brands snatched from the burning!
Say, Dud, maybe they’ll give us a commission
on him! Hello, Pete! I didn’t see you on the
train. Who’s with you? All by your lonesome?
You know Dud Baker, don’t you? And this is Mr.
Crail. Crail, shake hands with Mr. Gowen. Crail
has just been rescued from a horrible fate, Pete.”</p>

<p>Gowen, a big, good-natured chap, who played
guard on the football team, smiled. “What was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
that, Jimmy?” he asked, as they climbed into the
single coach of the branch line and found seats.</p>

<p>“Why, he was on his way to Mount Morris, and
we spoke so eloquently of Grafton that he saw the
error of his way, and decided to turn back into the
path of righteousness.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Jimmy’s stringing me, Crail,” said
Pete Gowen, “but I’m glad you’re coming our way.
Football man?”</p>

<p>“Not much. I’m going to have a try, though.
Say, I’d ought to get me a ticket, eh?”</p>

<p>“Never mind it. Pay the conductor,” said Dud.
“It’s really a fact, Gowen. Crail was on his way
to Greenbank and changed his mind, and decided
to come with us.”</p>

<p>“It was our personal charm that did the business,”
said Jimmy. “What do you think of him
for a lineman, Pete?”</p>

<p>“If Dave Bonner sees him,” laughed Pete, “he
will be eating dirt no later than tomorrow P. M.”</p>

<p>“Eating dirt, eh? Sounds fine, but what does it
mean?” asked Crail.</p>

<p>“Tackling the dummy,” explained Pete. “We
have very tasty loam in our pits. You’re sure to
like it.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing. Only thing is, you fellows, I may
get the gate when I run up against the examination.
Think they’ll let me by, eh?” He appealed a bit
anxiously to Pete, and Pete smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“If Bonner and Bert Winslow were on the committee
you wouldn’t have much trouble,” he replied,
“but I don’t know how hard those entrance exams
are. Hope you pass, though, Crail. We need a
few fellows of about your build this fall. How did
you happen to change your mind about Mount
Morris?”</p>

<p>A Montfort Crail smiled. “Well, I’d made up
my mind to go somewhere. You see, I’ve never
had much schooling. I’m a good deal of a dunce,
I suspect. I saw this Mount Morris Academy advertised
in a magazine I picked up one day, and
wrote to them and got a sort of a circular. That
was last month. So I asked them could I get in if
I came, and they said I could if I ‘met the requirements.’
I didn’t know just what those were, but I
thought I’d take a chance. Then I ran across Harold
and his friend——”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Pete.</p>

<p>“I mean Logan and Baker here,” corrected
Monty with an apologetic grin at Jimmy. “They
told me about this place, and I thought ‘What’s
the good of going to Mount Morris when Grafton’s
an hour nearer?’ You see, I’ve had two days
on the cars, and I’m sort of tired of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason for coming,” laughed Pete.
Then he added, more seriously, “I’d advise you to
be prepared for a disappointment, Crail. I’ve an
idea they’re pretty well filled up, and you may find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
that they can’t take you. In that case you could
go on to Mount Morris, though.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Monty nodded carelessly. “I guess
there are plenty of schools in this part of the
country, eh?”</p>

<p>“What ought he to do?” asked Jimmy. “Go to
Pounder, and tell him he wants to enter, or—or
what?”</p>

<p>“If it was me,” replied Pete, “I’d see Charley
and tell him just what had happened. I have an
idea Charley would think it was a kind of a joke
on Mount Morris, and so he might stretch a point,
and make it all right for your friend. Pounder
might just say that they were filled up and all that,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Think Charley would see him?” asked Jimmy
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Why not? Go to his house if he isn’t at the
office. If there’s anything I can do, Crail, look me
up. I’m in Trow; Number 16. Jimmy’ll show
you.”</p>

<p>Monty thanked him, and the talk wandered to
other subjects; such as who was coming back, and
who wasn’t, the rumored changes in the faculty, the
prospects for the football team, and what progress
had been made by the squad that, following a custom
of several years’ duration, had been practising
at Grafton for the last week. Pete explained his
absence from the preliminary session. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
spent the summer in the Southwest with a surveying
party, and had only finished his work five days
before. Evidently, the hardships, some of which
he jokingly alluded to, had agreed with him, for the
big fellow looked as hard as nails, and wore the
complexion of a Comanche Indian. Monty Crail
listened politely, and in silence for the most part,
dividing his attention between his companions and
the landscape moving leisurely past the window.
Needham Junction is only four miles from Grafton,
but the train doesn’t hurry, and somehow usually
manages to consume the better part of twenty minutes
on the journey, making five stops at cross-roads
stations, and lingering socially at each. There were
few other Grafton students amongst the passengers
sprinkled through the car, for the train that Jimmy
and Dud had selected was not a favorite with the
fellows. The real influx would occur later in the
afternoon when the two expresses came in. Dud
and Jimmy had chosen to arrive early for the reason
that they were to have a new room this fall,
and there would be some work to be accomplished
before they would be fairly settled.</p>

<p>Monty viewed the country with favor. It was
all very different from both Indiana and Wyoming.
There was a softness and a peacefulness that were
attractive, and which, in spite of novelty, seemed to
the boy very homelike. Only once before had he
been in the east, and that had been when he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
nine years of age, and his father had taken him
on a hurried trip to Washington and New York.
Monty couldn’t remember many of the details of
that visit nor much of the places he had seen. As
he recalled it now, much of the time had been spent
by him awaiting his father in hotel rooms. From
the train window his gaze fell on restful, still, green
meadows, outlined by stone walls, on patches of
woodland, on squatty white farmhouses that seemed
rather to have grown than been built, on distant
hills, hazy blue in the afternoon light, on fields of
corn and blue-green cabbages, and potatoes and
golden pumpkins.</p>

<p>Everything was very different, even the trees and
the fences, and the faces he glimpsed at the little
stations, but there was no feeling of loneliness in
Monty. He was used to strange scenes, used to
being by himself and looking after himself. Even
before his father had died—he remembered nothing
at all of his mother—he had been left a good deal
to his own devices, and since then he had fended
entirely for himself, for Mr. Holman, his guardian,
attempted to exercise but slight control over the
boy. Monty was practically incapable of ever being
homesick, for the simple reason that for five years
he had had no real home, spending his summers
as it pleased him, usually at Windlass City, sometimes
on a ranch, and his winters in or around Terre
Haute. What had bothered him most the winter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
before, at Dunning Academy, had been the “staying
put,” as he called it. Accustomed to moving
about as, and when he pleased, being tied to a few
acres had proved a new and unpleasant experience.
Just now he was wondering whether he could accustom
himself to similar conditions this winter. He
meant to try hard, for here he was sixteen years old
and with less “book-learning” than most fellows
two years younger, and he realized that if he was
to get an education he must buckle down to it, and
restrain those restless feet of his. He didn’t want
to grow up an ignoramus. And then, too, Dunning
had given him a taste for the companionship of persons
of his own age, something he had enjoyed but
little. Until he had gone to the military school
his friends and acquaintances had been, with few
exceptions, men; Joe Coolidge, the mine superintendent;
“Snub” Thompson, “Tejon” Burns, Garry
Waters, who ranched on Little Horse Creek,
“Soapy” Baker, of the Meeteetse outfit, and a few
more commonplace and less picturesque gentlemen
in Terre Haute. Monty had begun to feel the need
of boy friends and boy interests, and perhaps it
was as much that need as a desire for knowledge
that had led him to fall in so readily with his guardian’s
suggestion. So far as making his way in
the world was concerned, Monty might have gone
along with no more knowledge of Ancient and
Modern Languages, higher mathematics, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
rest of the curriculum, than he possessed, for Mr.
Crail had left a good-sized fortune in trust for the
boy, and the Gros Ventre Coal Company, under
present management, was doing better than ever,
and that Monty would ever have to work for a living
if he didn’t want to was inconceivable.</p>

<p>When he had said that he had decided to go to
Grafton instead of Mount Morris, because it was
nearer he had spoken only part of the truth. The
chief reason had been that he had found in Jimmy
and Dud a hint of the companionship he craved.
An uneventful journey east and a night spent alone
in a New York hotel had left him ready to make
friends with almost anyone of his kind on slight
provocation. He was always able to amuse himself
very satisfactorily for awhile, as witness his
efforts with the news vendor, the information bureau
man and the conductor, but that sort of fooling
palled eventually, and having made the acquaintance
of Jimmy and Dud he felt it the part of
wisdom to continue it. He might, he told himself,
speaking from experience gained at Dunning, remain
at Mount Morris a month before he would
get on such friendly footing with anyone. And already
he had increased his circle of acquaintances
by one more, he thought, glancing appreciatively at
Pete Gowen’s homely and kindly face, and that was
doing pretty well. He had come east prepared for
hard sledding in the matter of making friends, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
he had heard all his life of the Easterner’s aloofness,
but here, with scarcely an effort, he was already
in possession of three—well, if not friends, at least
friendly acquaintances! If, he said to himself as
the engine announced the end of its leisurely journey
by a shrill whistle, the rest of the Grafton fellows
were as human and likeable as the three he
had so far encountered he was going to like the
place fine!</p>

<p>A minute or two later they were out on the platform,
bags in hand. And a minute later still they
were, all four, together with nine other lads, settled
in the queer vehicle that Jimmy called a
“barge.” The barge was long and open all around,
and had seats running lengthwise, seats upholstered
in faded crimson plush. There was a crosswise seat
in front for the aged driver, and the vehicle was
drawn by a pair of likely-looking gray horses. Although
the two long seats were designed to accommodate
some two dozen passengers, thirteen boys and
thirteen bags, with a sprinkling of golf-bags, tennis
rackets, cameras and overcoats, used about all the
space. The road did not enter the town of Grafton,
but skirted it, and almost before Monty had
begun to entertain any curiosity as to the school
itself the barge swung around a corner into River
Street, and the buildings and the campus were before
him.</p>

<p>Dud, sitting beside him with his suitcase on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
knees that Monty might have room for his kit-bag
on the floor, pointed out the buildings. “That’s
Lothrop, the one ahead there, nearest the street.
Jimmy and I room there this year. It’s the best of
the lot. Trow’s behind it. The next is School Hall,
and Manning’s the last in the row. The gymnasium
is back of Manning, but you can’t see it yet. The
frame house at the other side of the campus, behind
the trees, is Doctor Duncan’s. He’s the principal,
you know.”</p>

<p>Monty listened and looked with interest. As
the barge rolled down the freshly sprinkled macadamized
street, through alternating patches of
sunlight and shadow, he looked under the branches
of the bordering maples and saw a wide expanse of
turf across which marched a row of brick buildings,
the newer ones graced with limestone trimming, the
older one, School Hall this, saved from monotony
only by the ivy that clothed its lower story. Gravel
paths, shaded by tall elm trees, led across the turf,
and a wide walk of red brick ran from one side of
the campus to the other in front of the buildings.
A fence of roughly squared granite posts connected
by timbers enclosed the grounds. Further away,
in the direction of the river whose existence Dud
dwelt on, a second smoothly paved street proceeded
at right angles with the one they were on, and beyond
that was a second and narrower stretch of
turf—“the Green,” Dud called it—with two comfortable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
immaculately white dwellings nestling on
the nearer corner of it. “Morris and Fuller
Houses,” said Dud, waving a hand toward them.
“They’re dormitories, too. Small ones. Some fellows
like them, but I never thought I should. The
Field’s on the other side. You can see the grandstand
if you look quick.”</p>

<p>But Monty failed, for just then the barge turned
in at the carriage gate, and the trees closed in on
his view.</p>

<p>“Who’s for Lothrop?” asked the driver over his
shoulder as he pulled up at the corner of the newest
dormitory.</p>

<p>“We are,” announced Jimmy rather importantly,
as it seemed to Monty. “Come on, Crail. We’ll
leave the bags, and then go over to School.” Pete
Gowen and two other boys followed them out, and
then the barge rolled on to repeat the process at
Trow, and, finally, Manning.</p>

<p>Monty gave a sigh of satisfaction as he stood on
the edge of the turf and felt the grateful coolness
of the shadow cast by the big dormitory. They had
been cutting the grass that day, and the languorous
warmth of the air was scented with the wonderful
fragrance of it. In a near-by tree a locust rasped
shrilly, and Monty gazed curiously in its direction.
He would have asked what it was, but Jimmy was
leading the way toward the nearer entrance, and so
Monty took up his bag again and followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>It was a wonderful building that, Monty thought.
He glimpsed a wide carpeted hallway from which
opened comfortably, even luxuriously furnished
apartments, while, at the far end of the corridor,
a bewilderingly long way off, wide-open doors afforded
a view of white-draped tables with peaked
napkins like tiny Indian teepees dotting them and
the shimmer of polished silverware.</p>

<p>“Snakes,” murmured Monty, “this isn’t much
like Dunning!”</p>

<p>But the others didn’t hear him, for they were
chattering busily as they climbed the slate stairway
to the floor above. A corridor slightly narrower
than the one below ran the length of the building,
and on either side numbered doors, some open, some
closed, marched away.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” announced Jimmy, in the lead, and
pushed open one of the portals. “Say, Dud, this
is perfectly corking! And we’ve got a fireplace!
And look at the view, will you? Maybe this doesn’t
beat Trow, what?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<small>A ROOM AND A ROOMMATE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monty Crail sat in a spindle-backed wooden
armchair with his feet on the sill of the
low window, and his hands clasped behind
his head, and dreamily watched a solitary star—it
happened to be Venus, but Monty wasn’t aware of
the fact—brighten momentarily in the western sky.
It hung just midway between the topmost branches of
the two elms across the street, and it required little
imagination to almost detect the wire that held it
there! Supper was over, and the other inhabitants
of Morris House, saving Mrs. Fair and the maids,
had either wandered off to other scenes or were loitering
outside on the steps. Monty could hear the
voices from around the corner of the house.
Monty’s room was numbered—or, rather, lettered—“F,”
and was on the second floor. There were
three windows in it, one looking down on a small
patch of lawn, and then across River Street, and,
finally, in the general direction of Grafton Village,
and two others, side by side, staring rather blankly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
at this season against the leafy screen of a big horse
chestnut tree. Later, when the leaves were gone,
those windows afforded a fine view of Lothrop
Field and the tennis courts, and the diamond and
the gridiron and running track, and, further away,
glimpses of the Needham River that wound its
quiet way past the southern confines of the school
property. The twin casements were dormered, and
the small alcove so formed was occupied on one side
by a washstand, and on the other, a long shelf,
which, with the aid of bright-hued cretonne curtains,
formed a supplementary wardrobe designed to eke
out the meager accommodations offered by a tiny
closet.</p>

<p>The room, though small, was attractive. There
were two cot beds, one on each side of the chamber,
a brown oak study table in the center, two chiffoniers
to match, the aforementioned washstand,
two arm chairs of the Windsor pattern, a like number
of straight-backed chairs, and a small stand.
The center of the floor was spread with a brown
grass rug and smaller ones lay in front of the door,
and in the alcove. And there were, of course, lesser
furnishings, such as a green-shaded electric drop-light
on the table, a waste-paper basket with the
appearance of having been used at some time as a
football, a scarlet-and-gray cushion, which, because
there was neither window-seat nor couch, led a restless
life. Four pictures of no importance, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
large Grafton banner adorned the walls, and on
one chiffonier were several photographs, framed
and unframed. The walls were covered with a
paper of alternating white and buff stripes which
gave a sunshiny effect to the room. On the whole,
Monty’s new home was cheerful and comfortable,
and, while he would have preferred a study and
bedroom in one of the campus dormitories, he was
not at all dissatisfied.</p>

<p>He had been at Grafton twenty-eight hours, and,
to be exact, fourteen minutes, reckoning from the
time he had stepped from the barge at the corner
of Lothrop, and in that time much of a not exciting
nature had happened. He was reviewing that period
now, his gaze fixed intently on the star. He
had been conducted by Jimmy Logan in the august
presence of Doctor Duncan, the principal, and
had told his story. The Doctor—the fellows called
him “Charley,” but Monty had not achieved that
familiarity yet—had been visibly interested and
amused. In the end he had picked up the telephone
and consulted the school secretary with the result
that Monty, bag in hand, had presently followed
Jimmy across the campus to Morris House.</p>

<p>There Jimmy had left him, after extracting a
promise to return later to 14 Lothrop, and Monty
had been conducted upstairs by a stout and short-breathed
lady whom the boys called “Mother Morris,”
but whose real name was Mrs. Fair. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Fair was the matron, and what the fellows termed
“a good sort.” Left to himself, Monty had wandered
about the room, hands in pockets, looked out
the windows, and finally unpacked his bag. After
that there had seemed nothing to do save look up
Jimmy and Dud, and so he had returned to Lothrop.
By that time the campus and the dormitories
presented a quite different appearance, for another
train had come in, and boys of all sorts were in
evidence on walks and in doorways, and on the
stairs and in the corridors. One fell over a bag
at every turn. Jimmy and Dud were hanging pictures
and arranging their belongings, their trunks
having arrived, and Monty had helped to the best
of his ability. Now and then a boy had wandered
in to say “Hello,” pour out a rapid fire of questions
and answers, shake hands with Monty and
hurry out again. And finally supper time had come,
and Monty had gone back to Morris House and
partaken of cold lamb and chicken salad and graham
muffins and pear preserve and three glasses
of milk at a long table, and in the presence of eleven
other youths of assorted ages, sizes and looks.
Monty had been introduced to them all, but acquaintanceship
had for the time ended there. After supper
he had wandered off for a walk along the twilight
roads, and across the campus and past the
buildings and had returned to Morris tired enough
to go to bed and sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>He had found Room F in possession of a tall,
loose-jointed youth, with tow-colored hair plastered
greasily to his head, and a pair of pale, near-sighted
eyes under colorless lashes. This was Alvin Standart,
the rightful owner of one-half of Room F.
Monty had met him at supper, but had not thought
of him as a roommate. Standart seemed anything
but delighted with the idea of sharing the apartment
with the newcomer, and Monty, for his part,
was not sensible of any particularly joyous emotions.
Standart hadn’t impressed him favorably.
He didn’t yet, after a day’s acquaintance. Standart,
in the first place, didn’t look clean. Monty
seriously doubted that he was. And he had unpleasant
manners. Standart was the one fly in Monty’s
ointment this evening. Everything else had turned
out beautifully. The examination, conducted by
Mr. Rumford, the assistant principal, had been far
less severe than Monty had feared. He and three
other rather anxious looking youths had assembled
in a classroom in School Hall that morning after
breakfast, and had been questioned as to their previous
studies. Two simple problems in algebra, a
sight translation of a dozen lines of Ovid, a test
in German grammar, and the ordeal was over.
Two of the applicants were passed into the Junior
Class, and two into the Lower Middle, Monty being
one of the latter. He had not impressed the
instructor very deeply, he concluded, for “Jimmy”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Rumford had viewed him for several long moments
with an expression plainly dubious.</p>

<p>“Passing this test,” said the Assistant Principal,
in conclusion, “doesn’t mean very much, young gentlemen.
It means only that the school is giving you
an opportunity. Whether you remain with us or
flit away to other fields depends entirely on you.
We don’t encourage loafers here. If you’ll all remember
that it may save you future sorrow and
regrets. Hand these slips to Mr. Pounder, the secretary,
please, and he will assign you to your classes.
If there is anything you want to know, you will find
me here between eight and nine in the morning, and
from five to six in the afternoon. You, er—Crail,
ought to be in the Upper Middle Class, sir, but
I don’t see my way to placing you there. If you’ll
take my advice you will do your best to make the
jump at the beginning of the next term. I think
you can do it. That is all. Good morning, young
gentlemen. Success to you.”</p>

<p>Recitations that day had been short, the time in
each case having been largely consumed in arranging
for future work. Monty found that his schedule
included Latin, Mathematics, English, German (he
had selected it instead of the alternative Greek) and
Physical Training. Dud had, however, informed
him that Physical Training was only for those who
did not go in for a regular sport. The studies
footed up to twenty hours a week, and Monty wondered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
whether he would survive the first week!
That afternoon he had joined Dud and Jimmy and
a new acquaintance named Brooks, and with them
watched football practice. The fact that his playing
togs were in his trunk, and that his trunk had
scarcely yet started from New York prevented him
from joining the candidates that afternoon. He
had purposely refrained from checking his baggage
to Greenbank yesterday, preferring to make certain
first that he was to remain there, and while he had
delivered the check to the agent here in Grafton
at noon with reiterated requests to have the trunk
forwarded as soon as possible, it was not likely
that he would receive it before the next afternoon.</p>

<p>Football practice at Grafton was quite different
from the same thing at Dunning Military Academy,
he decided. At Dunning the squad seldom exceeded
thirty candidates, while here the field was literally
thronged with ambitious youths. At Dunning only
the “hefty” ones were encouraged, but at Grafton
it seemed that any size or shape of a boy could have
a try-out. Only the juniors were barred, Jimmy explained.
Ed Brooks—Brooks was a catcher on the
baseball nine, Monty learned later—estimated the
number of candidates in sight as close on eighty,
which was very nearly a third of the total enrollment.</p>

<p>“There won’t be so many next week, though,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
added, pessimistically. “They fade away fast! Say,
Bonner’s got a peach of a tan, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>Bonner, Monty gathered, was the coach, a middle-sized
man of just under thirty, alert and quick,
with a peremptory voice and a settled scowl. Or,
at least, Monty concluded that the scowl was settled
until “Dinny” Crowley, the assistant athletic
director, had tossed a word to him in passing, and
the coach’s face had lighted with a smile that chased
the scowl away, and made Monty smile in sympathy.
Practice was not very interesting that afternoon.
Only the fact that nothing more exciting offered itself
kept the spectators there until the squads were
sent back to the field house. After that, Jimmy
had suggested walking to the river, and they had
done so, and Monty had had his first sight of a
canoe in actual use, and had mentally registered
a vow to become the proud possessor of one at the
earliest possible opportunity, and spend all his spare
time paddling up and down the little stream.</p>

<p>Still later, he had joined the Morris House fellows
on the steps before the supper time, and, without
taking much part in the talk, had in a way established
himself as one of the crowd. Of the eleven
youths, who, with Monty, made up the roster at
Morris, seven were what Monty unflatteringly
termed “Indians.” Monty would have had some
difficulty in explaining just what he meant by the
term, but it satisfied him. Perhaps when we remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
that in the neighborhood of Windlass City,
Wyoming, the noble Red Man is not held in high
regard we may form a fair estimate of the seven.
Further light is shed by the fact that Monty secretly
dubbed Alvin Standart a “Digger.” I believe that
the Digger Indian is considered especially low caste
and subsists principally on such luxuries as wild
roots!</p>

<p>Monty’s verdict regarding the seven was hasty,
and later he revised it with regard to several of
them. It is a mistake to judge others on the evidence
of a day’s acquaintance, and so Monty
found it.</p>

<p>After supper he had climbed to the room, Standart
being out, and had seated himself in the chair,
and propped his feet comfortably, if inelegantly, on
the sill to think things over. He decided that he
was going to like Grafton School; that, on the whole,
he was glad he had substituted it for Mount Morris;
that he would have to do some hard studying
if he was to secure that promotion in January; that
he would certainly “have a stab at it”; that Alvin
Standart was a most undesirable roommate, but
would have to be made the best of; and that if he
got a chance to show this eastern bunch how to
play tackle or guard, why, they’d learn something!</p>

<p>The evening sky grew a deeper blue. Somewhere
afar off in the direction of the town a light glowed
wanly. The air that entered the open window still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
held the heat of the sun, and, while fresher than
before supper, gave no promise of a cool night.
Sitting indoors until bedtime did not appeal to
Monty, but neither did joining the crowd outside
on the steps. He would have looked up Dud and
Jimmy again, but didn’t want them to think that he
meant to fasten himself on them for the rest of
the school year. He supposed that it would be all
right to pay a visit to Gowen, but Gowen’s invitation
might have been more polite than sincere, and
Monty still clung to his belief that easterners were
stand-offish and resentful of anything that looked
like “butting-in.” But not going over to Lothrop
was not, after all, a great deprivation, for, while
Monty liked Dud and Jimmy, and was grateful to
them for their friendship, they did not fill the want
that he felt. Dud and Jimmy had each other, and
although they always made him feel that he was
welcome, still he realized that he was by no means
essential to their happiness, and that what liking
they had for him was, so far at least, due to the
fact that he was a bit different from the run of the
fellows they knew, and that he amused them. What
Monty really wanted was a chum of his own, someone
he could talk to about the little, intimate things
of life, someone who would like him because he
was just Monty Crail, and not merely because he
was “western” and amusing. It would, he thought;
a trifle wistfully, be a wonderful thing to have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
real chum. Well, that sort of thing just happened,
he supposed. You didn’t go out and find a fellow
whose looks you approved of and link arms with
him and say, “Hello, <em>hombre</em>, let’s you and I be
friends!” Monty grinned at the mental picture of
what would happen if he followed such a course.</p>

<p>“Guess,” he muttered, as he dropped his heels
from the sill, and heaved himself from the chair,
“the poor fellow would drop dead of heart disease!”</p>

<p>He clapped his straw hat to his head—Monty’s
hat had no regular position, but stayed wherever it
happened to land, even if it happened to be over
one ear—“cinched” up his belt another hole, and
went downstairs. The group on the steps was reduced
to a quartette now, and although no one said
anything to the new boy each looked at him as invitingly
as dignity permitted. But Monty failed to
read invitation in their glances, and so passed on
down the steps and turned into the well-worn path
that led back between Morris and Fuller across the
Green to Front Street and the athletic field. Set in
the right-hand pillar of the ornamental gateway was
a bronze tablet on which, enclosed by a border of
laurel leaves, was the inscription: “Lothrop Field.
In Memory of Charles Parkinson Lothrop, Class
of 1911.” Monty wondered what deed Charles
Parkinson Lothrop had performed to be so honored.
And then the real portent of the phrase,
“In Memory of” came to him, and his face sobered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
and the brick and stone pillars and the wrought-iron
gates took on a new dignity in his eyes. And
standing on the steps that led down to the broad
path of the field, looking over the acres of level
turf dotted with white figures where the tennis players
were wresting a last hour of pleasure from the
growing twilight, he thought that the boy could
scarcely have had a finer memorial than this.</p>

<p>He paused outside one of the back nets and
watched two youths send the balls back and forth
with what seemed to him miraculous ease and certainty.
The players were in white flannel trousers
and white, short-sleeved shirts open at the necks.
They wore no caps, and their hair was damp with
perspiration. Monty had never played tennis, had
scarcely ever watched it played, and the way in
which the contenders darted on silent, rubber-shod
feet here and there about the court, always anticipating
the ball correctly, struck him as surprising.
He stood there for quite a while, nibbling a blade
of grass, and watched. Other courts held two,
three or four players, and through the deepening
dusk came the soft pat of ball against racket, the
swish of hurrying feet, the occasional voices of the
players, mellowed, as it seemed, by the warm twilight.
The boys before him played swiftly and
silently. They seldom spoke. When they did it
was only a few brisk words, as “Hard luck, Hal!”
when the effort of one went for naught, or “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
sorry!” when a ball rolled into an adjacent court
and had to be chased. There was no announcing
of the score between aces. A wave of a racket
seemed to answer for speech in most cases. Probably,
thought Monty, they were chums and knew
each other so well they didn’t have to speak! He
envied them as he turned away at last, and went
on along the path between the courts and the curve
of the running track. Against the purpling sky the
football goals stood out like giant H’s.</p>

<p>The gravel path ended where a backwater of
the river, known as the Cove, stretched into the
field. It gave forth the stagnant, but not unpleasant,
odor of rotting vegetation, and over its quiet surface
the mosquitos hovered in swarms, and a dissipated
dragon-fly who should have been at home
long since darted and swooped above the still reflections.
Two skiffs lay half pulled out on the muddy
bank, and one held a pair of weather-stained,
broken-bladed oars. Monty would have preferred
a canoe, and there were plenty of them further down
the Cove, as he knew, but canoes were liable to have
jealous owners, whereas he couldn’t imagine anyone
caring a whit whether he helped himself to one
of the leaky skiffs. So he shoved one off, put his
feet out of the way of the water that swished about
in the bottom, and dropped the oars into the locks.
Monty was not a skilled rower, and he ran into the
mud twice before he succeeded in getting the craft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
into the wider part of the Cove. On his left a
grove of trees came to the water’s edge, and a few
yards of mingled sand and pebbles there had been
ironically named The Beach. This was the bathing
spot approved of by the faculty, but few except
timid juniors used it. The others preferred the
boathouse float further up the river. Under the
trees, back of the beach, a dozen or more upturned
canoes rested, and as Monty went past another was
being put in place by returned mariners. Monty
could see the boys’ forms only dimly in the gloom
of the grove, but their voices and laughter came to
him distinctly.</p>

<p>“Lift your end, Hobo! Ata boy! Where’s the
other paddle? Oh, all right. I see it.”</p>

<p>“I say, do you know my arm’s lame, Nick? You
wouldn’t think a chap would get out of practice,
like that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Shows the enervating effect of the soft and
flabby life you’ve led this summer. Everyone knows
that your English climate is punk, anyway. Come
on, and—<em>Geewhilikins</em>! I walked square into a
tree!”</p>

<p>“’Ware timber!”</p>

<p>The voices diminished, and Monty’s skiff floated
out into the river. The light was still good here.
He turned the boat’s nose upstream and dug at his
dilapidated oars. The left one had lost nearly half
its blade, and so he had to favor it to keep from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
going aground. There was a faint breeze stirring
now, just enough to ruffle the damp hair on his
forehead and defeat the bloodthirstiness of the
mosquitos. Behind him the wake of the skiff dissolved
in coppery ripples. At his right the trees
and bushes cast purple-black shadows on the surface
and river and bank merged confusingly. The
stream was evidently deserted, and he was glad of
that, for his rowing was naturally erratic, and the
oar with the broken blade was making it more so.
Once he thought he heard a voice, but when he
turned his head and looked upstream no one was
to be seen, and he concluded that he had been mistaken.
Possibly it had been a bird. A hoot-owl
was crying in the distance, and somewhere, nearer
at hand, a whip-poor-will was calling sadly and
monotonously. Monty began to be conscious of a
vague feeling of unhappiness, of loneliness. The
quiet, shadowy river was strange, and seemed suddenly
unfriendly. He wished he could look up and
see the purple-gray peak of Mt. Leidy. He felt
strangely homesick just then for his mountains. And
so it was something of a relief as well as a surprise
when, out of the silence and darkness, a warning
cry arose, and was followed by the thump of colliding
craft.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>BATTLE ROYAL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Idiot!”</p>

<p>The voice, sharp, querulous, came from the
gloom on the heels of the collision, and Monty
half unseated by the shock, struggled around and
peered surprisedly at the speaker. The skiff had
wandered almost to the bank, and, since he was himself
now in the darkness of the bordering trees,
Monty had slight difficulty in making out the shadowy
form of a canoe drawn close to the shore, and its
lone occupant. The face of the latter was indistinct,
only a grayish oval, but Monty was instantly convinced
that he didn’t like it. In fact, he heartily
disliked everything about the unknown canoeist,
especially his voice.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you look where you’re going?” demanded
the other in tones that seemed to Monty
deliberately insulting, and that, very naturally,
roused his anger.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you give warning, Harold?” he retorted
promptly. “Think I’m an owl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“You row like one,” sneered the other boy.
“Blundering all over the river like that! Don’t you
suppose there are other fellows around here besides
you, you silly fool?”</p>

<p>The skiff had floated slowly away, scraping in the
twilight against the overhanging branches, but now
Monty pulled it back until it was once more alongside
the canoe, and he could grasp the gunwale of
the latter. “Say, partner, I can’t see your face,”
he replied, in the drawl that came naturally to him
when he was angry, “and so I don’t know whether
you smiled when you said that.”</p>

<p>“What if I didn’t?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that I’ll reach over and grab
you, Harold.”</p>

<p>“Try it, won’t you?” The voice sounded really
eager.</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered Monty. As he got to his feet
in the swaying skiff he thought that perhaps this
cocky youth might not be such a bad sort after all.
In Monty’s present mood a scrap seemed the most
desirable thing in life, and that the other fellow
was apparently of his way of thinking amounted
almost to a bond of sympathy. But Monty didn’t
take as much time for these reflections as I have
taken to record them, for he was essentially prompt
in his undertakings. So, too, was the boy in the
canoe, for he also was on his feet now, and when
Monty made a sudden lunge for him his fist shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
out, and only Monty’s quick duck of the head made
the blow harmless. The next moment, gripping
each other across the sides of the craft, they were
struggling mightily.</p>

<p>“Over you go, Monkey Face!” grunted Monty.</p>

<p>“I reckon—you’ll go—too!” panted the other.</p>

<p>Wrestling under such conditions is a precarious
undertaking, and presents novel difficulties. As the
boys leaned together their crafts in the most natural
way in the world slowly parted until presently
Monty was on his knees on the gunwale, and his
adversary, no longer able to stand up, became a
dead weight in his arms.</p>

<p>“Apologize?” demanded Monty grimly as the
water poured in about his knees.</p>

<p>“No, you—you dirty Yank!”</p>

<p>“Yank, eh! I’ll Yank you, you—” But Monty’s
powers of invention were handicapped, and he
gave his thought and strength to tearing loose
the grip of his opponent. It dawned on him
then that there could be just one climax to the
struggle, and he found time to grin before, the skiff
tiring of the unusual task required of it, he slid
gently forward into the river!</p>

<p>Fortunately, perhaps, there was a depth of only
some three feet just there. Monty, still clasping
his adversary, and still clasped, went sputtering and
gurgling to the bottom, or, at least, as near the
bottom as the body of the other, which happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to be underneath, would permit. The taste of the
water suggested that they had disturbed the muddy
sediment, and Monty was all for getting back to
air again. But no such idea seemed to possess the
other, for the death-like grip still held, and for a
fraction of a second Monty had a horrid vision of
drowning! Then, however, he found his knees,
and, at last, his feet, and, with the other boy still
clinging to him, managed to stand up.</p>

<p>“Had—had enough?” he gasped chokingly.</p>

<p>There was no verbal reply, but the adversary’s
actions plainly intimated that he hadn’t, for, once
out of the water, he began beating a clenched fist
into the back of Monty’s head, the only point he
could reach. Monty pushed his head as far out
of the way of punishment as possible, and, floundering
about in the water, slowly worked his right hand
up under the boy’s chin. No one can stand the
agony of having the head pushed back for long,
and gradually the boy’s grasp loosened until, with
a sudden effort, Monty wrested himself free, at the
same instant straightening his right arm. His opponent
staggered back, tried to recover, failed and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Monty awaited his reappearance, smiling grimly.
The humor of the thing struck him then, and the
smile became a laugh, and the laugh broke out just
as the other boy came out of the water again. With
a rush he returned to the fray, his hands aiming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
blows at Monty’s face, which the latter had difficulty
in avoiding, and which caused him to give
back toward the bank. He was watching for an
opportunity to close in, but the other afforded him
none. A staggering left to Monty’s cheek sent him
reeling on the rotting debris under foot, and he
brought up against the branches of an alder, and
then, losing foothold, sat down on the bank.</p>

<p>“Get up!” sputtered the other. “I’m just
started!”</p>

<p>Monty was dimly conscious of a small clearing
a few yards to the left, and concluded that he had
had quite enough of aquatic battling. Hurling himself
on the other, receiving a blow on the face that
jarred but didn’t stop him, he got his arms around
his adversary’s body, heaved, and staggered with
his struggling, infuriated burden through the shallow
water, and reached the bank. But to climb
out was beyond him, and in the effort he fell and
they rolled apart. Each got to his feet quickly,
panting, ready. There was a little light in the small
clearing, enough for each to see for the first time
the features of the other, and, while they paused,
as though by mutual consent to recover breath, they
made use of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Monty saw a tall, lithe, well-built boy of possibly
seventeen, with very dark hair—probably
black, although he couldn’t be certain of that—big
dark eyes in an oval face, a determined-looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
mouth, a nose that was a trifle aquiline, and a chin
that was at once pointed and strong. Monty’s first
verdict was: “Great Snakes, he’s a good-looking
<em>hombre</em>!” Then he added: “A regular dude,
though!” The boy’s attire was, in fact, almost too
picturesque, although his immersion had left it
somewhat bedraggled. His dark head was bare—perhaps
he had worn a hat and lost it, as Monty
had—a negligee shirt of some pale tint that in the
present uncertain light might have been blue or pink
or lavender clung to his body beneath a well-cut
jacket of some dark-gray material, his neck was
encircled by a soft collar which now lay like a
twisted rag, a flowing tie hung wet and stringy from
beneath it, there was a belt at the waist and a metal
buckle gleamed in the half-light, and his costume
was completed by dripping white flannel trousers
and discolored white buckskin shoes. Before the
encounter, reflected Monty, he must have been a
thing of beauty!</p>

<p>But, after all, there wasn’t much time for studying
the enemy, for the enemy was clearly impatient
for a renewal of hostilities. Monty was forced to
acknowledge, albeit a bit grudgingly, that the black-haired
chap had plenty of spunk. The recess lasted
less than a minute, and then they drew together
again, Monty stepping cautiously with guard down,
and the other dancing lightly on nimble feet, hands
up and moving impatiently, dark eyes snapping,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
mouth close shut, and with a little droop at one
corner.</p>

<p>The space they had found was barely twelve feet
in length along the river bank, and less than half
that in depth, and the ground was hummocky. Small
bushes, protruding roots and withered brakes made
uncertain footing, and the light was going fast. It
was very quiet, save for the gurgle of water where
the river washed past a pile of driftwood, and for
the deep breathing of the two boys and the brush
of their feet through the low bushes and yellowing
fronds. Then the black-haired youth rushed and
Monty met the onslaught.</p>

<p>As a boxer, Monty was not clever, and while he
managed to escape punishment for a moment or
two, and to even land once against the enemy’s
neck, he was presently giving back. His opponent
fought like fury, but with a science that was
something of a revelation to Monty. He had a
most disturbing way of leaving his right side unguarded,
and then, when Monty tried to reach his
head, ducking aside and at the same instant swinging
up with his right with disastrous effect to
Monty’s left ear! And every time Monty tried to
beat down his guard, and get his hands on him he
was brought up all-standing. It was after his opponent
had landed a fourth or fifth blow to the head
that Monty’s temper gave way, and, utterly regardless
of consequences then, he hurled himself on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
other under a rain of blows, and wrapped his arms
around his body. Then his right leg went back,
his grasp fell to the other’s waist, and he bore
backward. A shower of short-arm blows was ringing
against the back of his head and neck, and
he was growing dizzy under them when, with a
sudden, quick heave, he lifted the other from his
feet, and sent him crashing backward to the ground.
Monty was on him before he could move, pinioning
his arms to the earth.</p>

<p>“Coward!” gasped the other. “Fight fair!”</p>

<p>“That was a fair throw!” grunted Monty. “Give
up, do you?”</p>

<p>“No! Get off me! Let me up!”</p>

<p>“Not much, partner!” answered Monty grimly.
“You’ve made jelly of my ear, I guess. You’ll
stay where you are now until you cry quits.”</p>

<p>“Coward!” taunted the other again, writhing
under the weight that held him helpless. “Can’t you
fight with your fists?”</p>

<p>“Not so well as I can wrestle,” replied Monty
calmly. “Better stop kicking, you!”</p>

<p>“Let me up! Fight decently, you—you cad!”</p>

<p>“Look here!” Monty’s right hand traveled
slowly up, bringing the boy’s left arm to his
stomach. “Stop calling names!”</p>

<p>“Cad! Coward! Rotten Yank!”</p>

<p>“What’s to keep me from punching your face?”
asked Monty grimly, drawing up one knee and setting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
it on the imprisoned wrist while his left hand
strained at the captive’s right.</p>

<p>“Nothing! It’s what I’d expect of you, you—you——”</p>

<p>“Easy now! Be good or I’m likely to hurt you.
It would be fierce if I made a mess of that pretty
face of yours!”</p>

<p>He was having a hard time bringing that right
arm around. Both boys were panting hard. Just
how it happened, Monty never knew, but suddenly
he found himself sprawled aside, and, although he
tried desperately to hold his adversary, the latter
eluded him like a cat and was on his feet. Monty
had just time to spring erect before he was once
more beset. A blow on the chest almost lost him
his balance, and before he could recover the black-haired
youth had landed again on that long suffering
ear and had danced back. With a roar of rage
Monty rushed, took a blow that almost dazed him
and again wrapped his arm about the slim body of
the opponent. For a moment they swayed, struggled,
staggered about on the treacherous ground,
and then went crashing to earth, Monty on top. But
this time there was no need for him to grapple the
other’s arms. The boy with the black hair lay still,
with eyes nearly closed. Monty, suspicious, watched
a moment and then got unsteadily to his feet.</p>

<p>“Stunned,” he muttered. “Great Snakes, I hope
he isn’t hurt!” He went to the bank and dipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
cupped hands in the water and splashed it over the
boy’s face. He had to make three trips to and fro
before the boy on the ground stirred, sighed deeply
and opened his eyes. He viewed Monty at first
blankly and then dubiously in the half-darkness.</p>

<p>“What happened?” he asked weakly.</p>

<p>“Guess you hit your head on a root or something,”
answered Monty. “How do you feel?”</p>

<p>“All right now, thanks. What—oh, yes, I remember.”
He frowned and closed his eyes tiredly.
“Give me a minute or two and I’ll be ready,” he
added apologetically.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp072">“Great Snakes, haven’t you had enough yet!”
marveled Monty.</a></p>

    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_72">“Great snakes, haven’t you had enough yet!”

</div>

<p>“Have you?”</p>

<p>“Gee, yes, minutes ago!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, all right. I reckon I have, too.
Would you mind—” He struggled to sit up and
Monty dropped on his knees and propped him in
a sitting posture. “That was a fierce bump I got,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Monty cheerfully. “Didn’t mean
to hurt you.”</p>

<p>To his surprise the boy laughed merrily if
weakly.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke?” asked Monty, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Nothing, only—you said you didn’t mean to
hurt me,” gasped the other. “It—it sounded
funny!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“That’s so,” Monty allowed with a chuckle. “I
meant I didn’t mean to damage you, I guess. Look
here, we’d better be getting back. It’s pretty nearly
dark. Think you can make it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thanks. I’m all right.” With Monty’s
help he got to his feet. But he swayed and fell
against the arm that his recent adversary had put
out. “I’m sort of dizzy,” he murmured apologetically.</p>

<p>“Take your time,” said Monty, feeling of his
aching ear. “Say, where’d you learn to fight like
that, <em>hombre</em>?”</p>

<p>“I took boxing lessons for awhile. Did I get you
much?”</p>

<p>“Did you! I’ve got an ear on me that feels as
big as a football. Seems about the same shape, too!”</p>

<p>“You asked for it,” rejoined the other calmly.
“You ought to keep your guard up. I’ll show you
what I mean some time, if you like.”</p>

<p>“You’ve shown me quite enough, thanks,” answered
Monty decisively. “I know when I’m satisfied.
All right now? Say, what about those boats?
And I lost a perfectly good hat!”</p>

<p>“I reckon the boats will run aground somewhere,”
replied the other boy quite unconcerned. “If you
want to look for your hat, though——”</p>

<p>“No, let it go. Do you know how to get out of
here?” Monty surveyed the underbrush with misgiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“No, I was never here before. I reckon school’s
up that way somewhere. We’ll just have to break
through the bushes, I suppose. Shall we try it?”</p>

<p>“Have to, I guess. Gee, but it’s getting chilly!”
Monty shivered as a little night wind caressed his
damp form. “I’ll go ahead. I’ve done this sort of
thing before.” He started into the bushes and
pushed and crashed his way through them, his new
acquaintance following at his heels. It was nearly
pitch dark now and Monty had to guess at his direction,
but the fringe along the river was not deep and
presently, somewhat scratched by branches, they
stood on the edge of the field and the lights of the
school buildings twinkled across at them and a million
stars blinked calmly down from a purple-black
sky. To their right a darker shadow loomed and
Monty guessed it to be the boathouse. He chuckled
as he led the way across the turf.</p>

<p>“If we had gone a little further we’d have had a
better place for our scrap,” he said. “The boathouse
float would make a fine ring, I guess. Say,
what were we fighting about, partner?”</p>

<p>“I called you a silly ass or something, didn’t I?”
responded the other mildly. “And I think you called
me monkey face, and said you would lick me. I
don’t remember exactly.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” laughed Monty. “Fact is—er—I
say, what’s the name, eh?”</p>

<p>“Desmarais.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“Des—mer—er?”</p>

<p>“Des—ma—ray. It’s French.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, I was going to say that you happened
along when I was in just a nice mood for a
scrap, Des—Des——”</p>

<p>“Desmarais. Seems to me it was you who happened
along, though. I was sitting there in that
canoe doing a little thinking when you came out of
nowhere and slammed into me. I reckon I was
rather ugly about it, but I was feeling out of sorts
just then——”</p>

<p>“So was I! Fact is, I was getting homesick, er—
Say, what’s your first name? I can’t get the twist
of that one.”</p>

<p>“Leon.”</p>

<p>“Leon, eh? Mine’s Monty Crail. There’s more
of it, but that’s enough. What’s your class?”</p>

<p>“Upper Middle.”</p>

<p>“I’m in the Lower. I’m one of those backward
chaps you read about, I guess. Old Whiskers, who
put me through my paces this morning, says I can
get into the Upper Middle next term if I try hard,
and I mean to try, but, gee, I’m up against a tough
proposition, I guess. About all I know of German
is that you have to gargle when you talk it! You
been here long?”</p>

<p>“About twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“What? Are you a new fellow, too? Say, it’s
sort of funny our running across each other like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
this, isn’t it? I’m right cheered up about it, Lon.
I guess they’re right when they say misery loves
company. You don’t mind my calling you Lon, do
you? I never was much good at French.”</p>

<p>“I’d prefer to have you put the ‘e’ in,” replied
Leon, “if you don’t mind. Is Monty your real name
or just an abbreviation?”</p>

<p>“Short for Montfort.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s French, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my mother was French. But, I don’t remember
her at all.” They went up the steps at the
end of the path, passed through the gate, and crossed
the road to the Green. “Say, you’d better come up
to my room and fix up a bit, hadn’t you? I live in
Morris, the house on the corner there. I don’t
know what they think about scrapping here, but
maybe if a teacher spotted you there’d be trouble.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I will, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Hope my roommate isn’t in, though.
He’s a regular Indian. Here we are.” The steps
were deserted now, and although the open doors of
several rooms proved their occupants at home, Number
F was dark and empty. Monty switched on the
light, closed the door and viewed his new friend.
And Leon viewed Monty. And after a moment
their lips began to curve upward, and then, quite suddenly,
Monty had subsided on his bed, and Leon
on Standart’s, and they were shouting and rocking
with laughter!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>MONTY SHAKES HANDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">And, really, their appearance was cause enough
for laughter. Their clothes, no longer
dripping water but damp and creased and
dirty, were spotted with leaves and twigs. Collars
and ties hung like limp rags. Mud flaked from
their shoes. They were, in short, two as disreputable
looking youths as one could expect to encounter
in a day’s march, and, to add to their sorry appearance,
each bore evidence of the recent encounter.
Leon had escaped somewhat lightly, only a
bruise on one cheekbone showing, but Monty’s countenance
was sadly disfigured. His nose had bled a
little, his right eye promised to be purple by morning,
there was a contused area around his chin, and
that maltreated ear was, while not as large as the
football he had likened it to, at least much bigger
than the other one.</p>

<p>After a minute their laughter subsided into
chuckles, and Monty said a bit sheepishly: “I guess
we’re a couple of fools, partner!” But Leon shook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
his head as he wiped the tears from his eyes. “No,
we’re not, Crail. We had a good time, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Monty grinned. “Sure! And I guess I sort of
needed exercise, for I was getting mighty glum and
mean feeling. Do I look pretty bad?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t make a hit at a Peace Conference,”
laughed Leon. “You’d better let me fix you up,
Crail. I’m sorry I made such a mess of you. I was
in a beast of a temper when you came along. Come
on over to the stand here. Got a washcloth or
something?”</p>

<p>The next ten minutes were spent in repairs.
Monty discovered a bottle of witch hazel, presumably
the property of Standart, and they made liberal
use of it. A lump as large as a pigeon’s egg graced
the back of Leon’s head, its presence making itself
known when he leaned against the chair. However,
it didn’t show unless you looked for it. Monty’s
wounds were far more spectacular, although when
the blood had been cleaned from his lip, and his
other abrasions and swellings well bathed, and he
had slicked down his hair with a brush, he looked
fairly respectable once more. And presently the two
were comfortably seated by the window, and were
talking as intimately as old friends.</p>

<p>They had at least this much in common: both
were new boys and felt strange, and both agreed that
this part of the country in which they found themselves
left much to be desired. Leon compared it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
to the south and Monty to the west, and neither
comparison was favorable to this particular portion
of New England. Leon, it seemed, came from New
Orleans, and an awkward moment ensued when he
casually announced himself a Creole. Monty gazed
at him in a surprised manner. “A Creole!” he
ejaculated. “But—but—I thought——”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Leon stiffly.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Monty confusedly. “I—I
never met a Creole before.” But he continued to
gaze with misgiving at Leon’s hair, which, although
straight as his own, was undeniably black.</p>

<p>“You might as well say it,” challenged Leon.
“You thought a Creole was a nigger, didn’t you?
Most of you Yankees do think that, I reckon. It
just shows what an ignorant lot you all are!”</p>

<p>“I’m not a Yankee,” defended Monty. “I was
born in Indiana.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you thought, though,” sneered the
other. “Now, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly. I guess I had a sort of notion
that a Creole was something like a mulatto or
a quadroon. I’m sorry if I said anything——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you northerners all have that crazy idea,”
responded Leon, contemptuously. “A Creole is a
person born in Louisiana of French and Spanish
blood. We have the best blood in America in our
veins, as anyone knows who has read history.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I didn’t know,” replied Monty humbly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
“I never did read much history. I’m sorry if
I hurt your feelings, old man.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t,” answered Leon not very graciously.
“I don’t mind.” Then his face cleared, and he
smiled. “I do mind, though, Crail, to be honest.
You wouldn’t like it yourself if folks thought you
were half negro. It’s almost as bad as being called
a Cajun.”</p>

<p>“What’s a Cajun?” asked Monty.</p>

<p>“He’s a descendant of the refugees who came to
Louisiana from Nova Scotia along about 1765.
Acadians, they were called. Evangeline was a
Cajun.”</p>

<p>“Was he?”</p>

<p>Leon laughed merrily. “I reckon you don’t know
your Longfellow very well, Crail.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember. But I don’t think I ever read
the whole poem. It—it’s sort of long!”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been in New Orleans?” asked
Leon. He made it sound like “N’Orlins.” Monty
shook his head, and Leon promptly started off on a
glorification of that picturesque city, and Monty, listening
at first only politely, but soon with real interest
as Leon’s eyes glowed with fervor, and he pictured
so plainly that his hearer could almost see
them, the life and color and quaintness of a city so
foreign to any that Monty had ever known, determined
then and there to see New Orleans the very
first chance he got, and, above all, to go shooting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and fishing on the bayous below the city, those
bayous, ablossom with floating water hyacinths and
shaded by live oaks draped with Spanish moss, in
which alligators and terrapin and snakes dwell
amidst the swaying marsh grass, and where Filipinos
fish for shrimp and Kanakas and Cajuns and Japanese
and Italians and Indian half-breeds are mingled
in a strange hodge-podge.</p>

<p>“It’s New Orleans, isn’t it,” asked Monty finally,
“where they have Mardi Gras?”</p>

<p>But, to his surprise, Leon spoke belittlingly of
Mardi Gras. “It’s all right enough,” he said, “or
it used to be. But nowadays the railroads advertise
it, and people flock there from all over the country
and make nuisances of themselves. And they go
away with the notion that all New Orleans is good
for is just to hold carnivals. Which isn’t true, because
we’ve got one of the livest cities in the country.
Why, we export——”</p>

<p>And then Monty was treated to an exposition of
the city’s commercial importance that bored him
vastly, even if it impressed him, which, for Leon’s
sake, I hope it did. And then it became Monty’s
turn, and he sang the glories of Wyoming, and of
his beloved mountains, and sang them so eloquently
that Leon’s dark eyes warmed, and he made up his
mind that he would visit that wonderful Jackson
Lake country, and go hunting for elk and see the
sunset on the snowy tip of Two-Horn Peak and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
snowshoe down Halfway Pass, and sit around the
bunk-house fire with “Snub” Thompson and “Pin
Head” Farrel, and the other engaging characters of
Monty’s narrative! And then, Alvin Standart intruded
his unpleasing presence, and introductions ensued,
and Leon went his way. Monty accompanied
him to the sidewalk, and promised to look him up the
next morning. And at the last, as they were saying
good-night, Monty put his hand out or Leon put
his out—Monty never could remember which of
them had made the first move—and they shook
hands! Which is a most unusual thing for two
healthy, normal boys to do, and which, remembered
afterwards, brought something very like a blush to
Monty’s tanned cheeks.</p>

<p>“Who’s your friend?” inquired Alvin Standart
when Monty returned to the room.</p>

<p>“His name’s Desmarais,” answered Monty. “A
new fellow. He’s in upper middle.”</p>

<p>“Southerner, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, from New Orleans.”</p>

<p>“Thought so. You can generally tell by the way
they talk. Sort of drawl their words, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Do they? Can’t say I ever noticed it, Standart.”</p>

<p>“Sure, they do. They talk funny.” Considering
that Standart himself talked through his nose, and
flattened every vowel it was possible to flatten, it
didn’t seem to Monty that criticism of Leon’s speech
came well from him. But he only smiled. “You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
didn’t go to the reception, did you?” continued his
roommate.</p>

<p>“What reception’s that?” inquired Monty.</p>

<p>“Why, Doctor Duncan’s. Didn’t you know about
it?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, but I forgot it. What happened?”</p>

<p>“Just the usual things. We had a good feed,
though; better than last year. Say, some of the new
fellows are wonders, take it from me!”</p>

<p>“Very glad to. You ought to know a wonder
when you see it, Standart. By the way, I used some
of your witch hazel stuff. Thanks.”</p>

<p>“I should say you did!” exclaimed Standart, viewing
the nearly empty bottle scowlingly. “I say,
Crail, if you and I are going to get on, you know,
you want to cut out that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“What sort of thing?” asked the other mildly.
“Elucidate.”</p>

<p>“Why, I mean you’ve got to let my things alone,
Crail. Of course, I don’t mind you using the witch
hazel if you ask me, but you—you seem to have had
a bath in it! It was a brand new bottle! I’d rather
you asked me the next time, please.”</p>

<p>“Snakes! How much does the stuff cost you?
And how the dickens could I ask you when you
weren’t here?”</p>

<p>“You could have waited until I came, couldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t, Harold. I—I ran against something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and bunged my eye up, and if I’d waited for
you to trail into camp I’d have had a peach of an
eye by now. It doesn’t look any too pretty as it is,”
he added, observing it in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Stop calling me Harold,” said Alvin impatiently.
“You’re always doing it. My name’s Alvin, and I
wish you’d remember it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to,” Monty assured him. “Harold’s a
perfectly good name, though. Guess I like it even
better than Alvin.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether you do or not. It isn’t
my name.” Alvin put down the witch hazel bottle
with a frown. “That stuff cost me sixty cents,” he
announced, meaningly.</p>

<p>“Sixty cents, eh? It’s fairly expensive, isn’t it?
Guess I must have used about forty cents worth
then.”</p>

<p>“I guess you did. You can get this bottle filled
again at Thayers, in the village. Maybe they won’t
charge more than fifty if you have the bottle.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fair,” said Monty. “Maybe they won’t.
We’ll hope so, eh?”</p>

<p>“If you like, I’ll pour what’s in here into my
tooth-mug, and you can get it filled tomorrow. I
don’t like to be without witch hazel. It’s fine stuff
for cuts and bruises and——”</p>

<p>“Also good on bread,” suggested Monty cheerfully.
“For a cough or a cold there’s nothing like it.
A prize goes with every package. The finest of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
is a pearl-handled pocket-knife. Step up, gentlemen,
and have your money ready!”</p>

<p>Alvin viewed him disgustedly. “Cut out the
comedy, Crail,” he said, sourly. “Want this bottle
now?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. Maybe I’ll use a little more of
it in the morning, since you say it’s good. You
needn’t hurry about getting more, though, because
I guess I won’t need it.”</p>

<p>“Me? I’m not going to get more! You are,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no! Not so’s you’d notice it. Why,
if I went and had that bottle filled again I wouldn’t
be under obligations to you, old man. It would
be just like using my own witch hazel, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“That’s not funny,” grumbled the other. “You
ought to pay me something for what you used. Give
me a quarter and we’ll call it square.”</p>

<p>“Standart,” replied Monty severely, “you talk like
a Piute. Anybody would think you didn’t want me
to have that stuff. If I didn’t know you to be the
soul of generosity I’d think you wanted me to pay
for it!”</p>

<p>“So I do,” answered Alvin shrilly. “And I want
you to quit being funny. You think you’re a regular
comedian, don’t you? Well, you aren’t. You
make me tired. And I want you to leave my things
alone after this. And if you don’t pay for that witch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
hazel I’ll—I’ll get square with you for it some other
way.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, son.” Monty seated himself on
the edge of his bed, and thrusting his hands in his
pockets viewed his roommate gravely. “You and I
have got to bunk together here. And we’re bound
to see a good deal of each other, no matter how hard
we try not to. Now, I’m a great believer in being
happy whenever it’s possible. And I’m not going
to be happy if you annoy me. I’m queer that way.
I hate to be annoyed, Standart. It—it riles me.
Savvy?”</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t annoy you any more than you
annoy me,” sneered Alvin. “I don’t see why I had
to have you wished on me, anyway!”</p>

<p>“I’ve wondered the same, son, and I’ve concluded
that it’s probably because you needed someone to
lead you gently, but firmly toward better things,
Standart. You needed someone to cheer you up, I
guess. Say, is this grouch of yours something you
were born with, or did you just cultivate it?”</p>

<p>“None of your business,” growled Alvin. “You
let me alone.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s an heirloom, then; something that’s
been in the family for generations, eh? Well, it’s
a good one, only—only the trouble is that I’m likely
to find it tiresome, old man. Far be it——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!”</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to throw asparagus on a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
good heirloom, Standart, but I’d be awfully
much obliged if you’d mislay it some time, and
wreathe your features in a genial smile. Why,
snakes, man, do you know that ever since I arrived
here in your midst you’ve acted just like I wasn’t
welcome?”</p>

<p>“You’re a beastly fresh guy,” exploded Alvin,
“and someone’s going to hand you what you deserve
before you’ve been here long! You make me sick!”</p>

<p>Monty grinned, and began to disrobe himself for
bed. Alvin watched him gloweringly from across
the room. Finally: “You must be proud of yourself,”
he muttered, “being in the lower middle at
your age! Yah! You’re a smart guy, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“My education’s been sadly neglected, Standart,”
replied Monty gently. “But I’m going to remedy
that. I’m going to—” He paused, an expression
of dismay came into his face, and looked toward the
table. “Snakes! I plumb forgot to do any studying!
What do you know about that?” He chuckled
as he tossed his towel in the general direction of
the rack, and turned down his bedclothes. “Bet you
I make a big hit with the instructor tomorrow!”</p>

<p>Alvin viewed him balefully a moment. Then: “I
hope you flunk everything!” he croaked triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Thanks for your kind wishes, Harold! Good-night!”</p>

<small>THE NEW CHUM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monty did not, however, come such a cropper
the next day as he had predicted, partly
because he put in the best part of two hours
before breakfast in studying, and partly because the
instructors were lenient. He had Latin the first
hour, and scraped through, had German at ten
o’clock, and managed to look wise enough to arouse
no suspicion, had mathematics at eleven, and knew
more algebra than most of his companions, and finished
with English at two in the afternoon, having
for instructor Mr. Rumford, the assistant principal,
who was usually known as “Jimmy,” and whom
Monty had disrespectfully alluded to yesterday as
“Old Whiskers.” Monty, however, had intended no
disrespect, any more than when, in German class, he
had mentally dubbed Mr. Teschner “Google Eyes.”
The school in general called him “Jules,” but Monty
didn’t know that, and would have liked his own invention
better, anyway. It was not until after dinner
that he had an opportunity to keep his promise to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Leon Desmarais and climb the two flights of stairs
in Trow Hall, and demand admittance at the portal
of Number 32.</p>

<p>Leon was out, but his roommate, a stout, bespectacled
youth named Granger, insisted that he
should enter and await Leon’s return from dining-hall.
Granger, whose first name was Seymour, and
who was known as “Sim,” was a senior, and a “dig”
of the first water. Even now, when the sun was
shining brightly, and there was a fine, faint nip of
autumn in the air, Granger had chosen to immerse
himself in “Johnston’s American Politics,” with a
pencil sticking from a corner of his mouth, and a
pile of notes at his side. Monty marveled and envied,
and accorded Sim Granger then and there a
respect which never diminished. Granger apologized
for going on with his work.</p>

<p>“I’m taking four extras this year,” he explained,
“and it keeps a fellow rather busy.” He looked
across at Monty through his big spectacles with a
tolerant, even kindly expression, and gave the latter
the idea that he was speaking in words of one
syllable for his guest’s better comprehension.
Monty, for once in his life thoroughly awed, responded
somewhat indistinctly that it was quite all
right, and that he supposed it must, and please not
mind him at all. And, Granger smiling benignantly—he
had two perfectly developed chins, which made
his smiles much more effective—composed his large,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
round face again, and became immersed. From
time to time Monty dared a glance, but only a brief
one. A fellow who would willingly remain indoors
on such a September afternoon, and dig political history
was far too noble and great to be made the subject
of mere vulgar curiosity.</p>

<p>Number 32 was a very ordinary room, one of at
least sixteen more just like it in Trow Hall. It combined
the duties of bedroom and study—there were
a few suites of two and three rooms in Trow, but
only a few—and wasn’t very successful at it. Two
windows looked across the back campus to Crumbie
Street, and the slope of Mount Grafton beyond. The
only thing of interest in view, aside from the fields
and woods, was the little red brick, slate-roofed
building that held the heating plant. As far as view
was concerned, Monty much preferred his own
room, but he wondered if it wouldn’t be more fun
living in one of the big dormitories like Trow than
in Morris House. There was a window-seat under
the casements, covered with a rather hard looking
cushion and holding many pillows. Otherwise the
furnishings were much the same as those in Number
F, Morris, although not nearly so new. In fact,
about every article of furniture there appeared to
have a long and honorable history behind it, especially
the study table, which, covered in green felt,
had accumulated so many ink spots, and so many
names and initials and strange hieroglyphics that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
nowadays one had to take the original color for
granted. Several pictures and unframed posters
hung on the walls, and there was the usual Grafton
banner, in this case much larger and dingier than
usual. It wasn’t difficult to determine which chiffonier
of the two was Leon Desmarais’s, for one
held only a pair of battered military brushes, a
broken-toothed comb, a button-hook and a row of
unframed photographs, and the other boasted a traveling
case laid open to expose its silver and ebony
articles, three silver-framed photographs of rather
foreign-looking persons, and a leather belt with a
buckle that looked astonishingly like gold, and was
engraved with a monogram. And, in case there
might still exist the chance of mistake, from the
upper drawer escaped the end of a wonderful four-in-hand
tie with alternating bias stripes of dark blue
and bronze. Monty was growing a bit restless when
footsteps sounded outside the half-open door—there
had been several false alarms previously—and Leon
entered hurriedly and breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Crail,” he greeted. “I’ve been over to
your house to find you. That roommate of yours
said he didn’t know where you were, and, by George,
it sounded very much as though he didn’t care! Look
here, have you met Mr. Granger? Granger, this is
Mr. Crail, the chap I told you about. Let me see
how you look, Crail. Shucks, that eye isn’t so bad,
is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“My ear’s the worst,” answered Monty, investigating
it with a careful finger. “How’s your bump?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d forgotten about it. It doesn’t bother
any. I told Granger about our little set-to, so you
needn’t talk in parables. Granger seemed to think
it was unfortunate we didn’t both drown!”</p>

<p>“Silly kids,” murmured the stout one benignly,
keeping his place in Johnston’s classic with one pudgy
finger. “Ridiculous!”</p>

<p>Leon laughed gayly. “Everything’s ridiculous to
him, Crail, except the accumulation of worthless
knowledge. Let’s leave him to it, and get outdoors.
You haven’t anything this hour, have you?”</p>

<p>Monty said good-by to Granger, and followed
Leon out and down the stairs. On the front steps
Leon hooked an arm through Monty’s, and led him
along the brick walk toward the principal’s residence
and the tree-shaded road beyond. “Do you know,
Crail,” he said, “I believe I’m going to like this
place after all? I didn’t think so yesterday or the
day before, but it looks quite jolly now. I dare
say I’ll freeze to death when the cold weather comes,
but until then—” He broke off to search a pocket
of a gray tweed Norfolk, and produce the half of a
cake of sweet chocolate. “Have some?” he asked,
stripping the tinfoil off, and dividing the treasure.
“Look here,” he continued, when they had sampled
the chocolate, “I’m going to call you Monty. Maybe
Monte Cristo. Ever read it? Great, isn’t it? Let’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
climb that rock up there, shall we? What’s the thing
on top of it, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“Just a tower. Observatory, they call it. I guess
you get some view from there. Funny, though, to
call that little old hump a mountain. Out at Windlass
City it wouldn’t be more than an ant hill.”</p>

<p>“Look here, I’m going out there some day,” said
Leon. “It must be great. I looked it up on a map
in the library this morning. Your place is right next
door to the Yellowstone Park, isn’t it? Do you ever
go there?”</p>

<p>Monty shook his head. “I never have yet. It’s
only about forty miles, and I’ve always meant to, but
somehow I don’t get to do it. You come out there
next summer, and we’ll go all over the place.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to! How did you happen to come away
off here to school, Monty? Aren’t there any good
schools in the west?”</p>

<p>“Piles of them, but I thought I’d like a change. I
guess I got it, too,” he added dryly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I reckon Montana—no, Wyoming is a heap
different from this. But Terre Haute is quite civilized,
isn’t it? That is, a regular city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got a trolley car there, and several
business blocks,” laughed Monty. “How did you
happen to come here?”</p>

<p>“It was father’s idea. He said I ought to know
more about the north. Rather silly, I think. I’d
rather have gone to a place nearer home. Still this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
isn’t bad, and there are quite a few southern fellows
here. I wonder how we get up this hill.”</p>

<p>“There’s a path over there, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>There was, and ten minutes later they were climbing
the steps of the lookout tower that rose from the
granite summit of the hill. As Monty had predicted,
there was “some view.” Almost at their feet lay
the school grounds, dotted with buildings and intersected
with gravel walks. Further away was the
athletic field, with the freshly limed markings of the
tennis courts showing dazzlingly white, and beyond,
a narrow ribbon of blue, curved the Needham River.
Across the river lay a strip of forest, and then came
fields and winding roads, and here and there, a cluster
of farm buildings. The village of Grafton
seemed quite near with its three church spires and
square-topped town hall tower. They could see the
clock on the latter, and Monty, after a surreptitious
glance at his watch, said that he could even tell the
time, which was twenty-six minutes after one, and
Leon believed him at first, and was appropriately
surprised by his powers of vision. To the right of
the village was the railway station, and they could
follow the single line of track for some distance
westward. On all sides the distance melted into the
blue haze of a warm September day.</p>

<p>“It really is a very pretty country,” granted Leon,
“and lots greener than it is at home. I’ve never been
to England, but I reckon it must look a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
like this. I suppose you’ve been there, Monty?”</p>

<p>Monty shook his head. “Never been outside the
old U. S. A.,” he answered. “Jasper—he’s my
guardian—won’t let me go alone, and never offers to
take me with him. But some day—” His voice
dwindled away into a thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>“‘Some day,’” half grumbled Leon, “lots of
things will happen. There’s too much ‘some day’ to
suit me. I want things now.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Monty nodded slowly. “But, at that,
I guess it’s a lot better to have ‘some day’ to look
forward to than—than have it behind you, eh?”</p>

<p>“You’re a philosopher,” laughed Leon. “I don’t
like philosophy. Come along down. It must be
getting on toward two. What are you doing at
three?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. I was going to report for football
practice, but my trunk hadn’t come an hour ago, and
I guess it hasn’t got here since.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! Are you going in for that sort of
bunk, Monty?”</p>

<p>“Bunk? I’m going to try for the eleven, if that’s
what you mean. What’s wrong with it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the way you look at it, I suppose. I
never could see much sense in football or baseball.
I like a game that I can play by myself and——”</p>

<p>“Solitaire?” asked Monty gravely.</p>

<p>“I mean like tennis. If you lose at that it’s your
fault, and no one’s else, or if you win it’s your victory.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
But in football, why, you’re only one of a
dozen——”</p>

<p>“Eleven, to be exact.”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Monte Cristo! Your playing well may
not cut any ice in football, for some other idiot—I
mean some idiot——”</p>

<p>“I get you, partner. It’s all the way you look at
it. Are you going in for tennis, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got my name down for the fall tournament
that starts next week. Do you play?”</p>

<p>“Nary a play. It’s a girl’s game.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” Leon was outraged, and all the way
back to the campus he held forth on the merits of
tennis, growing more and more earnest as Monty
pretended to scoff. Monty found that it was a very
easy matter to fool Leon, and indulged himself in
the amusement quite frequently during the first weeks
of their acquaintance. After that the southerner became
wise to the fact that Monty didn’t mean all
he said, and that when he looked the gravest he
was always laughing in his sleeve. Monty allowed
himself at length to become convinced by Leon’s eloquence
of the many excellencies of the game of tennis,
and the two parted in the corridor of School
Hall after agreeing to meet after their recitations.</p>

<p>It was while in the middle of “Jimmy’s” English
class that Monty remembered that he had not sought
to find the runaway skiff in which he had embarked
last evening, and consequently, when Leon met him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
at a few minutes past three he broached the subject
and suggested that they go down to the river and
have a look. Leon didn’t seem particularly concerned
in the matter, but agreed to take part in the
search. Monty waited while the other ran up to
his room with his books, and then they strolled across
the campus to Morris, where Monty, in turn, disposed
of his burdens, and after that went on to the
field. The courts were already busy, and Monty
had hard work dragging Leon past them.</p>

<p>“That’s what I ought to be doing,” declared the
latter concernedly. “I need practice like anything.
I wish I knew some fellow who would take me
on. Maybe if I got my racket and stood around
someone would ask me. Do you know any fellows
yet?”</p>

<p>“Only three or four. I don’t know whether they
play tennis, Leon, but I’ll ask them if you say so.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. Who are they?”</p>

<p>“A couple of fellows who room together in Lothrop,
Logan and Baker, and another chap named
Gowen. Gowen’s a football player. And then
there’s that Indian, Standart, and two or three fellows
at Morris. I dare say some of them must be
tennis fiends, eh?”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d ask. I’d like to get used to those
courts a little before the tournament. They look
faster than the ones I’ve played on. Come along,
if we have to, and let’s find those silly boats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>That task proved very easy, for both skiff and
canoe were pulled up on the beach, and Monty’s
straw hat was awaiting a claimant on the end of an
upturned oar. “I never thought I’d see that again,”
said Monty, as he tried to pull the soft straw back
into shape. “Looks sort of—sort of——”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Echevelé</i>,” suggested Leon.</p>

<p>“Honest? As bad as that, eh? Well, I suppose
a hat that’s sat around in the water all night has a
right to look ‘aish-flay,’ or whatever you called it.
I suppose you talk French like a headwaiter, eh?”</p>

<p>“A little,” acknowledged Leon.</p>

<p>“And read it, too?”</p>

<p>“Not so much.”</p>

<p>“And—and think in it? Can you think in
French?”</p>

<p>“Better than I can talk it,” laughed Leon.</p>

<p>Monty sighed enviously. “That must be great,”
he said. “The only language I know is English,
and Mr. Rumford is beginning to make me think I
don’t know that! And I can talk enough Spanish
to navigate a burro, and can tell German when I
see it printed. There comes the football mob. Want
to watch them for awhile?”</p>

<p>Leon good naturedly consented, and they found
seats on the stand, and leaned luxuriously back in
the sunlight, and waited to be amused. And there
Pete Gowen spied Monty, and so came hustling
across to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, Crail, how are you getting on?” he asked.
“Why haven’t you been around to see me?”</p>

<p>“Thought maybe you had troubles enough of your
own. Shake hands with Desmarais. Leon, this is
Mr. Gowen. He’s the man they’re building the team
around this year.”</p>

<p>Pete laughed as he acknowledged the introduction,
and then asked soberly: “Why aren’t you out,
Crail?”</p>

<p>“I am out. This is me.” Monty tapped his chest.</p>

<p>“Out for practice, I mean. Didn’t you tell me
you played, and were going to try for a place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that. Why, yes, but I haven’t any togs. My
trunk hasn’t caught up to me, Gowen. I’ll be on
hand tomorrow, though.”</p>

<p>“Be sure. Don’t put it off. I told Winslow I’d
found him a guard, and he’s expecting me to make
good on the promise. So long. Glad to have met
you, Desmarais.” Pete didn’t exactly say “Desmarais,”
but he said something that sounded nearly
like it, and hurried off again.</p>

<p>“He’s a big brute,” commented Leon. “Can he
play well?”</p>

<p>“So they say. He seems an awfully decent
<em>hombre</em>.”</p>

<p>“What’s a <em>hombre</em>?” asked Leon.</p>

<p>“Man. I like the looks of that quarter, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Which is the quarter? Oh, the fellow with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
reddish hair. Yes, what’s his name? He looks as
though he could play tennis.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think it’s Weston. Say, they’re
a likely looking bunch, aren’t they? Snakes! I hope
my trunk gets here before tomorrow afternoon. I’m
crazy to get my hands on a football.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you luck, Monty. Who’s the cross-looking
man with the old flannel trousers?”</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Bonner, the coach. They say he’s a
dandy.”</p>

<p>“Glad he doesn’t boss me. He looks as though
he could bite a nail in two this minute. There’s a
chap speaking to you, Monty.”</p>

<p>The chap proved to be Jimmy Logan, and when
Monty returned his greeting he climbed up to them.
“Hello, Crail! Say, have you seen Dud Baker?
The idiot promised to play some tennis this afternoon.”
Jimmy was sweeping the scattered audience
in the stand and along the edge of the field with a
frowning gaze. “He’s a lazy guy, though, and had
rather watch other fellows exercise than do it himself.
He’s probably here somewhere about.”</p>

<p>Monty introduced Leon to Jimmy, adding: “If
Baker doesn’t show up this fellow will take you on
at tennis, Logan. He’s the champion of the southern
states, Desmarais is, and has never been defeated.”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Monty!” protested Leon.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” asked Jimmy eagerly. “Do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
you really want to play, Des—er—I didn’t get the
name, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Desmarais,” supplied Monty. “The accent
comes on the antepenultimate syllable. The K is
silent as in French.”</p>

<p>“Yah! And I suppose his first name’s Harold?”
jeered Jimmy. “Maybe he’s another of those Eskimo
Twins!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s the third of them. Go ahead and
whack your little white balls around, Leon. I’ll
come over after awhile.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to play very much, thanks,” said Leon,
“if you don’t find your friend, Mr. Logan.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to look for him any longer. Have
you got your racket here?”</p>

<p>“No, but it won’t take me a minute——”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll wait for you here. Payne is keeping
a court for me, so don’t be long.” Leon hurried
off to Trow, and Jimmy turned inquiringly to Monty.
“Who is the raven-tressed youth, Crail? What the
dickens did you say his name was?”</p>

<p>“Desmarais. The accent——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but never mind that, laddie. Southerner,
isn’t he? Won’t do to get him angry with me, will
it? They’re a fiery lot, those southerners. Believe,
though, southron is the proper word. How are you
getting on? Sorry yet that you changed your mind
about Mount Morris?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, thanks. And I’m getting along very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
comfortably so far. I think I’m going to get downright
fond of this place, Logan.”</p>

<p>“You bet you are,” said Jimmy seriously. “You’ll
never regret following my advice and side-stepping
Mount Morris, Crail.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did I do that?” asked Monty politely.</p>

<p>“Sure!” responded Jimmy without a quiver.
“Don’t you remember? If you don’t you’re the only
one,” he added with a chuckle, “because all the fellows
I’ve told remember!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Monty laughed. “You’re welcome
to the credit.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you been around to see us? We’ve
got the old sty fixed up corking now. Come and
see it, and bring your friend Dejeuner, or whatever
his name is. Listen; give me another lesson, will
you? Go ahead: Des—Des——”</p>

<p>“Des—ma—ray. Say it quick and you won’t
mind it.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t remember it five minutes,” said Jimmy
sadly. “Here he comes now, on the dead run. Say,
if you see Dud Baker tell him I hope he chokes.
Good-by! My love to the Eskimo Twins!”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">The next day Monty appeared, appropriately
clad, on the football field at a few minutes
before three-thirty, and gazed inquiringly
around. Most, if not all, of the candidates were
on hand, and the rest were dribbling along the path
from the direction of the field house. Mr. Bonner,
however, was not in sight, nor was Pete Gowen,
and Monty wondered whether he was supposed to
simply stroll out and join the nearest squad or to
report to someone and get instructions. He decided
to make inquiries as to the usual methods pursued
in such cases, and walked up to a youth of eighteen
or thereabouts, who, dressed in football togs that
had apparently never been worn before, presented
an immaculate and almost unapproachable appearance.
He was a tall, finely-built, and very good-looking
youth, but his good looks were somewhat
marred by an air and expression of arrogance.</p>

<p>“Say, partner,” observed Monty, “I want to get
into this. What do I do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Starling Meyer turned slowly and viewed the
questioner with languid surprise and contempt, or
so it seemed to Monty. Meyer’s eyebrows went up
and a flicker of amusement showed in his eyes as
his gaze traveled deliberately from Monty’s head
to the tips of his scuffed shoes and back again.
Finally: “Really,” he replied, “I don’t care what
you do. But I’d suggest that you have your hair
cut.”</p>

<p>Monty’s eyes narrowed a trifle, but he only smiled
pleasantly. “You don’t understand,” he said gently.
“What I wanted to know was about getting on the
football team. You see, I’ve decided to play, and
I don’t know whether I ought to tell the captain
about it or—or what. And you looked as if you
might be the coach or something.”</p>

<p>Meyer frowned suspiciously, but the other boy’s
smile was so innocent and placating that the frown
vanished, and the look of amusement deepened.
Meyer even chuckled a bit. “Oh, so you’ve decided
to play football, have you?” he asked. “That’s fine,
isn’t it? What position have you selected?”</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to be one of the fellows who
take the ball and run with it,” responded Monty
almost shyly. “You call them halfbacks, don’t you?
I can run pretty fast, I can. But Alvin Standart,
who’s my roommate, says that maybe they won’t
use more than two halfbacks this year, and if they
don’t, I wouldn’t get to be one, because they’ve got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
two already. Do you know if they’re going to have
more than two?”</p>

<p>“Three or four, I understand,” answered Meyer
gravely. “If I were you I’d see Mr. Bonner, the
coach, and tell him I had decided to be third halfback.
Better do it before some other fellow asks
for the place. He’s coming now. Better get right
at it.”</p>

<p>“I will,” declared Monty brightly. “And I’m ever
so much obliged to you. Are you one of the
players?”</p>

<p>Meyer nodded. “I’m right and left guard,” he
replied. “By the way, what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Crail. What is yours, please?”</p>

<p>“Heffelfinger. If you like, you may use my name
to the coach. Just tell him Heffelfinger, Walter
Heffelfinger sent you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you! I—I think I’ve heard of you.
I guess everyone has! You’re sure you don’t mind
if I just say that you—you——”</p>

<p>“Not a bit.” Meyer waved a hand courteously.
“Go as far as you like, Crail. Remember now;
third halfback is what you’re after.”</p>

<p>“Third halfback, yes. Or maybe fourth, if someone
has chosen to be third? Anyway, I’ll ask to
be third first. Thank you so much, Harold.”</p>

<p>“No, not Harold; Walter; Walter Heffelfinger.
Good-by, and don’t take any wooden money.”</p>

<p>Monty showed clearly that the latter advice puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
him, but he nodded gratefully, and turned away.
Meyer chuckled as he watched the other’s progress
along the line in the direction of Coach Bonner.
Then something in the boy’s swinging stride, or,
perhaps, something in the capable poise of the head,
brought suspicion back again, and the chuckle died
away in his throat.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he—” But he didn’t go any further.
Instead, he shook his head impatiently, banishing
the unwelcome suspicion, and watched Monty approach
the coach, speak to him, shake hands and
engage in conversation for a minute before Mr. Bonner,
pointing into the field, dispatched the new candidate
to join one of the squads. Starling Meyer
smiled. He wished he could have heard that conversation.</p>

<p>A half-hour later, when the squads had been
cleared from the gridiron, and a first and second
eleven were trotting out for the initial scrimmage
of the year, Meyer, consigned with many others to
a rôle of watchful waiting, approached Mr. Bonner,
who was at the moment alone, near the side line.
“Did that new fellow get the position he wanted, Mr.
Bonner?” he asked with a chuckle.</p>

<p>The coach turned. “Hello, Meyer. What was
it you asked?” Meyer repeated the question, and the
coach looked puzzled. “What fellow was that?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Crail, or some such name. He wanted to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
third or fourth halfback. Asked me if you were
going to use more than two this year. I told him
he had better see you before some other fellow got
ahead of him,” laughed Meyer.</p>

<p>The coach frowned, and shrugged his shoulders.
“The only Crail I know of is a candidate for guard.
I’m afraid,” he added, as he turned away, “someone’s
been stringing you, Meyer.”</p>

<p>And Meyer, his self-conceit horribly jolted, was
afraid so, too!</p>

<p>Nothing especially notable occurred that afternoon,
either to the new guard candidate or to anyone
else. A tentative first squad went through two
ten-minute periods against an equally tentative second,
and neither scored. Substitutions were frequent,
but neither Monty nor Meyer left the bench
again until the practice was over. Monty had given
his name and other particulars to a youth named
Burgess, the manager, and later on, in the field house,
he had stepped on the scales and tipped up a hundred
and forty-one pounds. A little Welshman who
went by the name of Davy, and whose official capacity
was still a mystery to Monty, informed him that
he was several pounds over weight. Monty refused
to argue the matter, although Davy had the aggressive
look of one who would have liked an argument
better than his supper! Subsequently, Monty discovered
that Davy Richards was the trainer. And
subsequently, too, he made the acquaintance of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Sargent, the physical director, and of Mr. “Dinny”
Crowley, his assistant. These gentlemen controlled
the physical, and, in a way, moral welfare of the
football candidates, while Coach Bonner confined
himself wholly to implanting in them as much knowledge
of the game as his ability to teach and their
ability to learn made possible. Football at Grafton
School was taken seriously, and pursued systematically
and efficiently. Compared to the happy-go-lucky
methods in vogue at Dunning Military Academy,
the Grafton system impressed Monty immensely.
The only feature of it that he couldn’t quite approve
of was the apparent disposition to lose sight of the
individual. As Monty put it to Leon on one occasion,
they threw every fellow into the same pot and
boiled them all together! But that criticism came
later. During the first fortnight of his stay at Grafton
Monty formulated no criticisms. He was, perhaps,
too busy getting shaken down into his new
existence.</p>

<p>In those two weeks his preconceived ideas of
boarding school life were much altered. He had
unconsciously expected to hang up his hat, say
“Howdy,” and instantly take his place in the school
world. Rather to his surprise, he had discovered
that there was no place awaiting him, that if he
wanted a place he would have to make it. As far
as he could see, no one bothered the least bit about
him, neither principal, faculty nor students. If he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
didn’t want to study there was no one to insist on
his doing so. He merely flunked, and nothing happened.
At least, nothing happened for a considerable
while. Eventually, though, something did happen.
He went on probation, and was given a ridiculously
brief space of time in which to recover his
standing. If he didn’t he packed his trunk and disappeared.
Many fellows did just that during the
year. That Monty wasn’t among them was mainly
because he asked questions, and reasoned things out
and had the sense to see that the broad and easy
path of idleness led eventually to the gulf of disaster.
Besides, he wanted to study, anyhow. He
wanted to know things. He wanted especially to
get out of the lower middle class into the upper
middle, for Alvin Standart’s jeer still rankled. As
to making a place for himself, well, Monty meant
to do that, too, and was only wondering how to
go about it. The end of that first fortnight found
him wiser, somewhat disillusioned, and quite resolved
to make good.</p>

<p>On the football field he was still an unknown candidate
for a guard position, working hard when he
was given the chance, and making no spectacular
success of it. But he learned a good deal. At Grafton
they were extremely particular about the little
things. Details that were scarcely considered at
Dunning were held here of great importance. Mr.
Bonner seemed to have a perfect passion for drilling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
the candidates in the rudiments. Monty sometimes
wondered how the fellows had the courage
and perseverance necessary to survive that first three
weeks. For that matter, some of them didn’t. The
eternal grind killed their ambitions, and they disappeared.
Usually such defections passed unmourned,
for it was the coach’s belief that those who couldn’t
survive the grind and hard labor of that preliminary
season were not of the quality he wanted. Gradually
the number of candidates dwindled from some sixty-odd
to around fifty, and this in spite of the fact
that a call for more candidates had brought out a
handful of late arrivals. The first cut in the squad
came ten days after the beginning of the school year,
and reduced the total to about forty. Monty survived
that cut, but he had fears of the next, for it
seemed to him that there was no place for his services.
For the two guard positions there were to his
certain knowledge six candidates besides himself, and
each of the six were fellows who had played last
year on either the first or second teams. Kinley and
Gowen were the first-choice men, with Hersum,
Bowen, Little and Williams struggling hard for substitute
positions. Monty couldn’t see where he came
in, and he began to consider his chances of finding
a place on the second team which was due to be
chosen in another week.</p>

<p>Grafton played her first game the second Saturday
of the term, and defeated the Grafton High School<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
eleven with no difficulty by the score of 21 to 0. The
Scarlet and Gray played pretty raggedly, in spite of
a team composed very largely of experienced players,
and the four ten-minute periods provided scant
interest for the audience. Leon declared that it was
a sin to adjourn the tennis tournament for such a
silly proceeding, and Jimmy Logan agreed with him.
The tournament was three days old, and had reached
the semi-final stage, and Leon was among the survivors.
He had won two matches, one by default,
and was looked on as certain to fight it out with the
present champion in the last round. Jimmy, entered
in the doubles with Brooks, had pulled out a victory
that morning, and was due to play again Monday
afternoon. But Jimmy had no expectation of
surviving the next match. Jimmy’s particular chum,
Dud Baker, had met his Waterloo in the first encounter,
and was now rooting hard for Leon to come
through.</p>

<p>Jimmy and Dud had taken Leon up with enthusiasm.
Jimmy had fallen victim to Leon’s skill in that
first game of tennis, and Jimmy had a worshipful admiration
for anyone who could play good tennis.
Later Jimmy suspected that Leon had purposely let
him down easy on that occasion, since in subsequent
encounters Leon had, to use Jimmy’s expressive description,
“simply wiped up the blooming court with
him.” Within a few days Jimmy and Dud and Leon
and Monty had established a four-cornered friendship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
that bade fair to last, unless, as sometimes
seemed possible, they fell out over the question of
school societies. Jimmy was a member of the Literary
and Dud of the Forum, and each sought to get
Monty and Leon pledged for his own favorite. There
were some rare arguments in Number 14 Lothrop,
with Monty and Leon playing the rôle of audience.
When discussion waxed too warm it was Monty’s
way to announce that, for his part, when it became
necessary to decide between the merits of the two
societies he meant to toss up a coin! In the end,
which wasn’t until the next term, the matter was settled
in quite another fashion, but that doesn’t enter
into this story.</p>

<p>Leeds High School was defeated, 39 to 0, the
next Saturday, by which time Grafton had found
herself to some extent. Monty got into that game
for a very few moments toward the end, and perhaps
because by that time the Leeds line was largely
a substitute affair, did well enough at left guard.
Both the Grafton High and Leeds High contests
were looked on as merely practice games, and the
first real encounter was that with St. Philip’s School,
a week later. In preparation for that event, the first
squad was started in on the development of an attack
and Mr. Crowley rounded up his second team and
began to put it through its paces. Rather to his surprise,
Monty was neither drafted to the second nor
banished from the first, but continued to adorn the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
bench during the scrimmages, sometimes being called
on to substitute at one side or the other of Ned Musgrave
or Brewster Longley, first and second choice
centers. In those days the haughty Starling Meyer,
or Star, as he was generally called, usually kept him
company. Star, however, treated Monty with silent
contempt, something that bothered Monty not at all.
Star was trying for a back field position and was said
to have designs on Ordway’s job at right half.
Sometimes Monty surprised Star looking at him with
a puzzled expression as though wondering where innocence
left off and guile began. On such occasions
Monty always smiled expansively and Star removed
his gaze with much dignity.</p>

<p>But before the Leeds game arrived Leon had won
honor and renown by capturing the Fall Tennis
Tournament with ease. In the final match he won
from Ainsworth, holder of the title, 6–1 6–3,
5–7, 6–4, and had shown a brand of tennis that
was nothing short of a revelation at Grafton. That
Leon would succeed to the Tennis Team captaincy
in the spring was a foregone conclusion. <cite>The
Campus</cite> devoted quite a half column to him in the
November issue and predicted a decisive victory over
Mount Morris next May. In such manner Leon became
almost overnight a person of importance at
Grafton, and especially amongst a fairly large tennis
element. The result was that he viewed the fate
which had exiled him to the cold and inhospitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
north much more kindly and no longer seized every
opportunity, as had been his custom, to compare
New England unfavorably to his beloved south.
Leon had made a place for himself, in short, and
was fitting nicely into it.</p>

<p>Monty was still jostling around on the fringe of
things, trying hard to convince himself that he “belonged,”
and not succeeding. Two things were worrying
him about then. He was having difficulty with
both German and English and was not getting on at
all smoothly with his roommate. He told himself
that whether Alvin Standart liked him or whether he
liked Alvin were matters too small to bother about,
but nevertheless rooming with a chap who spent all
his time nagging or glowering was not pleasant.
Monty saw as little of Alvin as he could manage, but
it wasn’t possible to avoid him entirely. Alvin, it
seemed, was capable of nursing a grouch for ever
and ever, and Monty had the feeling that the tow-headed
youth was watching and waiting for an opportunity
to revenge himself for the loss of that
forty cents worth of witch hazel. Sometimes Monty
wished he had replaced the precious fluid as Alvin
had demanded. At the time the latter’s peevishness
had seemed too childish to merit serious attention,
and Monty had refused recompense, not from stinginess,
but, as he put it to himself, to teach Alvin the
virtue of generosity. Meanwhile Alvin had himself
replenished the bottle at least once. Monty sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
thought the boy bathed in it, for, as near as he
could determine, Alvin seldom bathed in that more
usual element, water. It was his dislike of water,
and soap as well, that brought about the first physical
encounter between the occupants of Number F.</p>

<p>One morning in the second week in October Alvin
was in the process of performing his usual style of
morning toilet, that process consisting of dabbing a
moist washcloth over his eyes, nose and chin, and
rubbing a toothbrush very sketchily across his teeth.
Monty had witnessed like performances many times
without protest, but this morning he lost patience.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever wash yourself, Standart?” he
asked contemptuously.</p>

<p>“What am I doing?” asked Standart, peering
scowlingly over the folds of his towel.</p>

<p>“Search me! It’s what I’d call a lick and a promise,
though. Why don’t you pour another spoonful
of water into the bowl and use the soap and go after
the dirt? Honest, Standart, I couldn’t tell from
looking at the back of your neck whether you were a
blonde or a brunette!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up! I wash myself as clean as you do,”
muttered the other. “You think the more water you
splash around the room the cleaner you are. And
my neck isn’t dirty, either. You mind your own business,
you—you cowboy!”</p>

<p>“It’s my business if I have to live with you,
<em>hombre</em>,” replied Monty. “Go ahead now. Just try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
it once. It won’t hurt you. You might grow to like
it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you call me dirty!” cried Standart shrilly.
“I’ll wash the way I want to, and if you don’t like it
you can lump it!”</p>

<p>Monty glanced at the closed door and arose from
the bed whereon he had been seated while awaiting
his turn at the washstand, with a smile of anticipation.
Standart, towel in hand, watched him suspiciously.
“Let me show you, partner,” said Monty.
“It isn’t half as bad as you think it is.”</p>

<p>“Keep away from me!” threatened Standart, dropping
the towel and seizing his tooth-mug. “Don’t
you dare touch me! If you come any nearer I’ll
throw this!”</p>

<p>“If you do you’ll break it, son,” replied Monty.
“And if you broke it you couldn’t brush your teeth
any more. And if you couldn’t brush your teeth
your heart would break, too. And——”</p>

<p><em>Whizz</em> went the tooth-mug, but Monty ducked
and it banged against the further wall, to the marring
of the plaster and rolled under a bed. Just one
instant later Standart was choking, sputtering, writhing
and kicking as, held firmly in Monty’s grasp, he
was subjected to ablutions as enthusiastic as they
were informal. Monty scorned the few cupfuls of
water in the basin. Instead, he dipped Standart’s
washcloth in the pitcher, rubbed it on the soap and
set to work. His left arm encircled Alvin’s neck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
and held tightly a generous fold of his pyjama jacket
and his right wielded the cloth. The victim of his
philanthropy said things, or tried to say things, that
were, to say the least, ungentlemanly. Some of the
expressions he sought to enunciate were of the sort
never used in polite society. But whenever he threatened
to become the least bit coherent Monty deftly
introduced the soapy, dripping washcloth into his
mouth, with the result that Standart’s remarks were
for the most part made from between clenched teeth,
and therefore they lacked conviction. But, at that,
he managed to make considerable noise, and Monty,
fearing that interruption would come before his task
was completed, worked hard and fast.</p>

<p>“Behind the ears, Standart,” he said. “And
around the back of the neck. That’s the ticket.
Quiet, <em>hombre</em>! Where do you get that stuff, son?
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? All right, keep
quiet then if you don’t like the taste of it. Sorry
you’ve got these pyjamas on, because I’d like mighty
well to do this job proper. Kicking won’t help!
And never mind pinching! A little more water
now——”</p>

<p>“If you don’t—gurgle—I’ll kill—gug, gug—you,
you——!”</p>

<p>“Your language would make a horse-thief blush!
I’m ashamed of you, Standart. Almost through
now. You can’t expect me to get all the dirt off the
first time, son, but if you behave nice I’ll have another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
go at you some day. I can almost see your skin here!
Now, then, we’ll wash the soap off!” Whereupon
Monty seized the half-filled pitcher and quickly and
unsuspectedly inverted it over Standart’s head!</p>

<p>At the same instant, three occupants of neighboring
rooms, having knocked and hailed without response,
thrust open the door. Monty with the self-congratulating
expression of one who has performed
a difficult task with neatness and dispatch, had retreated
from the scene of action, and Standart, gasping
and spluttering incoherent vows of revenge, was
standing, drenched to the skin, in an ever-widening
pool of water. The boys in the doorway looked for
a moment with wide-open mouths, and then three
shrieks of laughter drowned Standart’s angry threats.</p>

<p>“Wha—what’s up?” gasped Joe Mullins delightedly.</p>

<p>“I’ve been helping Standart wash,” answered
Monty calmly. “He couldn’t reach the back of his
neck.”</p>

<p>“You wait!” shrilled Standart, darting shiveringly
for his gown and throwing a malevolent glare at the
amused audience in the doorway. “He held me and
poured the pitcher over me! He—he——” But
there Standart’s words became unprintable. Mullins
called a halt sternly.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Alvin!” he said. “You ought to have
your mouth washed too. I’m glad Crail has washed
your dirty face. It’s needed it for a week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Mullins closed the door again and the trio went
chuckling off to bear the glad tidings that at last
Standart’s neck and ears had been washed! In
Number F the victim of Monty’s kindness sat on
the edge of his bed trying to dry his drenched body
and at the same time express in adequate terms his
gratitude. He hadn’t nearly finished when Monty
bore off the pitcher to the bathroom for refilling, nor
was he through when the latter returned. But presently
his words trailed off into vindictive mutterings
and the mutterings into silence. But Standart’s expression
said plainly that in his opinion the incident
was not yet closed.</p>

<p>The affair made a pleasant break in the monotony
of daily life at Morris House and Standart didn’t
hear the last of it for some time. He fulfilled none
of his threats to take the matter to faculty, probably
because he had no taste for the incident publicity,
nor did he complain to “Mother Morris.” But Mrs.
Fair doubtless learned of the happening, for more
than once when the others referred cryptically to the
back of Standart’s neck, or asked interestedly: “How
are the old ears today, Alvin?” Monty noticed a
demure flicker of amusement cross the lady’s face.</p>

<p>So far as practical results for good were concerned,
Monty’s object lesson in cleanliness was
hardly a success, for after that Alvin took a huge
delight in ostentatiously avoiding water and soap,
and only had recourse to them when driven to it by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
threats. And so the incident was apparently at an
end. But Alvin nursed his wrath and waited patiently
for an opportunity to wreak vengeance, and
when the opportunity came proved that the enmity
of even a “Digger Indian” is not to be scoffed at!</p>

<small>SOME VICTORIES AND A DEFEAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The St. Philip’s game proved a rude awakening
for Grafton, for four twelve-minute periods—St.
Philip’s had insisted on forty-eight
minutes of playing time—left the two teams virtually
where they had started, on an even footing.
To be sure, each team had managed to secure one
field-goal in that time, but the final score of 3 to 3
was indecisive. And from the Grafton point of view
it was very disappointing. St. Philip’s was a new
opponent and, while rumor credited her with football
strength and Grafton had looked for a hard contest,
she was not expected to prove the Tartar she had
shown herself.</p>

<p>Grafton could find no consolation in the fact
that, if she had not won, neither had she lost, for
an unbiased analysis of the game showed that the
home team had been out-played from first to last
and that had the fortunes of war dealt fairly with
each team St. Philip’s would have gone off with a 3
to 0, or even possibly a 6 to 0, victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>As Captain Bert Winslow said afterwards, no
light team had ever faced Grafton with so much
punch in attack and dogged resistance in defence as
the late adversary. Outweighed many pounds in the
line, St. Philip’s had overcome that handicap by an
almost phenomenal speed. Time after time her
linemen had “got the jump” on Grafton, and time
after time the best efforts of Winslow and Ordway
and Manson and, later, their substitutes, had gone
for little or nothing. Around-the-end attempts had
been early shown futile, and Grafton, after many
failures to puncture the line from tackle to tackle,
had had recourse to the kicking game. But even
there her opponent had bested her slightly, while the
longest and best placed of Captain Winslow’s or
Quarterback Blake’s punts had missed effectiveness
by reason of the brilliant running back of the St.
Philip’s quarter and left half. St. Philip’s had
earned her lone tally honestly when, after four long
runs from wide formation that started in her own
territory and took the ball to Grafton’s twenty-six
yards, she had twice failed at an advance and had
sent her drop-kicker back to the thirty-five-yard line.
Although the angle was fairly difficult, and although
Pete Gowen and “Hobo” Ordway had both broken
through, the kick was made slowly and carefully and
went directly across the center of the bar. That was
in the second period. Again, in the third, St. Philip’s
came near to scoring another three when a place-kick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
from the thirty-eight yards struck the upright
and bounded back.</p>

<p>Grafton’s single score had been secured in the last
period. With defeat staring her in the face, she had
commenced and executed a creditable march up the
field in which a quarterback run and a forward-pass
had featured and had eventually reached St. Philip’s
twelve yards. There a fumble had cost her a down
and lost her four yards. Subsequently, Ordway had
been thrown back for a loss. Then, on third down,
a fake forward-pass had sent the ball to Fullback
Manson and that able-toed young gentleman had
put the pigskin across easily enough from the thirty-yard
line.</p>

<p>Monty had failed to get into that contest for even
a minute and had watched it with mingled feelings
from the bench. No one asked Monty’s opinion, but
he had one nevertheless. To paraphrase a celebrated
quotation: “Breathes there a boy with soul so
dead who never to himself hath said: Things would
have been different had I led!” Perhaps Monty
didn’t say just that, but he did confide to Leon and
Dud and Jimmy that evening that it was his firm
conviction that Coach Bonner would do well to pay
less attention to the little things and more to the big.
“What’s the good,” he wanted to know, “of spending
a month learning half a hundred unimportant details
and not knowing how to use what you learn?
If our backs had forgotten a lot of slush about standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
just so and having one foot ahead of the other
and counting one, two, three after the signal and all
that, and had just taken the ball any old way and
slammed into that line we might have done something.
They were so busy remembering the by-laws
that they never got started until the other fellows
were tackling them!”</p>

<p>That led to an argument, with Jimmy Logan on
the other end, which continued until Leon, yawning,
requested them to dry up.</p>

<p>“It’s all very unimportant, anyhow,” he said.
“Football’s a crazy game and only wild men play it.”
And, of course, Monty had to deny that and another
argument began.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of argument between the
four, and they settled, to their own satisfaction, at
least, many problems that autumn. The subjects
left undiscussed were few indeed, and Number 14
Lothrop and Number 32 Trow were the scenes of
many earnest debates. (The quartette seldom met
in Monty’s room, since there was always the chance
of Alvin Standart’s making himself an unwelcome
fifth. None of the others could stomach Alvin.
Leon, indeed, held him in the utmost loathing.) The
debates were always good-tempered. Leon was the
only one of the four in danger of losing his temper
in the heat of an argument, and the others saw that
he didn’t. It was usually a nonsensical remark by
Jimmy that saved the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>But football was not the only interest at Grafton
just then. October had come in with frosty nights
and mornings and days that held just the right
amount of snap to put zest into life. The maples
fluttered their red and orange and yellow leaves
down and the elms laid russet carpets on sidewalks
and paths. The baseball players were holding fall
practice each afternoon, and Dud, already slated to
lead the pitching next spring, was very busy. Jimmy
and Leon played tennis a good deal. There was
work, too, for the track and field candidates, and as
for the fellows who slammed little white balls for
miles over the yellowing turf, why, they were in their
element. The river of an afternoon, especially if
the afternoon happened to be Sunday, was quite
crowded with canoes. Monty, impatient of delays,
purchased a maroon-colored canoe from Pete Gordon
and, coached by Leon, became a skilled paddler
in a surprisingly short time. The fine weather lasted
the month through and life at Grafton was very
pleasant. It would have been much pleasanter, in
Monty’s opinion, had there been no such things as
German and English, for he was not doing very well
with them. He tried for permission to exchange
German for Greek, but was denied. Mr. Rumford,
however, told him he could make the substitution
with the beginning of the mid-winter term if he managed
promotion to the upper middle at that time.
Monty saw no prospect of it, though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>The second week in October witnessed the final
cut in the football squad and left just twenty-nine
players extant. Of these eighteen constituted the
regulars and enjoyed the distinction of eating at
training table, while the remaining eleven substitutes
got along as best they might with the assistance of a
diet list, which, I fear, was seldom regarded. The
second team also went to a training table. The second
took itself very seriously and, under the care of
Mr. Crowley, fast developed into a formidable aggregation.
Monty survived the final cut, but still
could figure himself no better than a third substitute.
Starling Meyer terminated his connection with football,
being too haughty to go out for his class team
after being rejected by Coach Bonner. Doubtless it
peeved him not a little to see that the boy whose
amazing innocence he had laughed at had survived
where he had failed!</p>

<p>Monty didn’t go with the team when it traveled
away from home to play the Rotan College freshmen.
He wasn’t included in the list of those to be
taken along, and, while he would have liked to have
gone with the half-hundred rooters who accompanied
the team, a falling-out with Mr. Rumford prohibited.
Jimmy thought it better for Monty to
remain at school and labor on an English 2 composition.
Last year Rotan had beaten Grafton on
Lothrop Field by the score of 20 to 6, and Grafton
wanted revenge. That she obtained it was due principally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
to Manson’s good right foot, for he barely
managed to convert Grafton’s single touchdown into
seven points, while the freshmen, after smashing out
a touchdown in the first ten minutes of the contest,
failed to kick goal. The score of 7 to 6 was not
decisive, but it constituted a victory, and Grafton,
team and rooters, returned home in triumph.</p>

<p>Grafton met her first defeat the following Saturday
at the hands—or possibly it would be more
proper to say the feet—of St. James Academy. The
game was on Lothrop Field. St. James was unable
to do much with the home team’s line and,
after the two elevens had played each other to
a stand-still for two periods, she opened up her
bag of tricks and showed that both the Grafton
ends were far from impregnable. When Foster
Tray gave place to Milford, gains around the
Scarlet-and-Gray’s right became less frequent, but
Mann, who succeeded to Derry’s place, was no improvement.
St. James worked forward-passes with
fair success and used a split attack from kick formation
in which quarterback took the ball outside tackle
that made many gains until Grafton finally solved
and smothered it. Grafton’s attack seemed very
weak that day, but the truth was that her rival had
a strong line that played low and hard. Once Hobo
Ordway got loose for thirty-odd yards, and several
times Brunswick, who went in for Captain Winslow
in the third quarter, snaked through for gains of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
from three to six. But invariably St. James tightened
inside her thirty-yard line and four times Grafton
lost the ball on downs almost under the shadow
of the opponent’s goal. Twice she might have tried
field-goals and didn’t. It was explained later that
Coach Bonner had forbidden them. St. James, with
no such prohibition governing her attack, landed two
drop-kicks over the bar and took the game home
with her. As heretofore Grafton had always won,
that 6 to 0 victory was a surprise to the Scarlet-and-Gray,
and an unpleasant one. Monty played nearly
the whole of the fourth period at right guard and
handled himself well even if he created no sensation.
He sustained an honorable injury in the form of a
black eye, of which he was secretly very proud while
it lasted.</p>

<p>By this time Monty’s circle of acquaintances had
widened. That he had increased the number of his
friends is doubtful, however. Acquaintanceship and
friendship are different craft. He felt no need of
more friends, though, for Leon and he were inseparable
chums, while Jimmy and Dud were a good
deal more than mere acquaintances. In a casual way
he came to know half the fellows in the football
squad, some quite well; Pete Gordon, the substitute
center, Tom Hanrihan, the big tackle, Nick Blake,
the innocent-visaged, mischievous quarter, “Hobo”
Ordway, who played right half and who, so rumor
had it, was an English Earl when he was at home!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Bert Winslow, the captain, Monty counted as an
acquaintance, too, but Bert was too busy and absorbed
in his tasks to pay much attention to the substitute
guard. And there were others: Foster Tray,
who played right end, Gus Weston, the chap who
was so earnestly striving to oust Blake from the
quarterback position, Oscar Milford, a second-string
end and Paige Burgess, the team’s manager. At
Morris House, Monty knew his companions even
more intimately and had revised his opinion of several.
Joe Mullins, for instance, was not at all the
“Indian” Monty had dubbed him, but a very decent
fellow indeed who occupied the unofficial position
of house captain and ruled them all with a light but
firm hand. And there was, of course, Alvin Standart.
And very often Monty wished heartily that
there wasn’t.</p>

<p>In short, Monty was finding his place by degrees
and enjoying himself in the meanwhile. He sometimes
missed his beloved mountains and sometimes
felt a bit lonesome for no reason that he could discover,
but as time went on he took more kindly to the
tranquil, well-kept country around him and the lonesome
spells became less and less frequent. He often
wondered what would have happened had he not
pitched into that bullying newsboy in New York. In
that case Jimmy Logan wouldn’t have spoken to him
and he would have gone on to Mount Morris, as he
had first intended. Probably he would have liked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the Greenbank school quite as well as he now liked
Grafton, but he wouldn’t have met Leon Desmarais.
He concluded that Fate had treated him well, for he
had grown very fond of Leon and couldn’t imagine
an existence that didn’t include him. Of course they
quarreled now and then. Leon had a temper like a
spring-trap. It always went off suddenly and unexpectedly.
When thoroughly angry he was, to use
Monty’s metaphor, “a regular bob-cat.” But Leon’s
rages soon burned out and, since it took a lot to make
Monty lose his temper, their quarrels were usually
rather one-sided and speedily over, and left no scars.
Leon was inclined to be a bit snobbish in the matter
of birth, something that Monty was quite indifferent
to. Monty had once remarked that it didn’t seem
to him to matter much who one’s great-grandfather
was, and Leon had been quite scandalized.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that birth doesn’t count?” he had
exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, birth?” Monty had asked.
“My father was a perfectly respectable American
and my mother was a French woman. Neither of
’em was ever in jail.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a silly ass! Anybody could tell that you
come of good family, Monty. The west is full of
families from the south and east, of course. But do
you mean to tell me that generations of breeding and
culture don’t count? If your grandfather had been
a rag-picker—What are you laughing at?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“You’re so serious! Suppose he had been a rag-picker?
What of it? The man who picks rags today
deals in them tomorrow and gets rich. His
children go to school and his son sells the land the
junk-shop was on and starts a dry-goods store on the
next corner. And in a few years he’s rich, too, and
becomes a bank director. And his son grows up and
marries the daughter of the wealthiest man in town.
And if you met <em>his</em> son on the campus tomorrow
you’d think ‘There’s a chap with breeding!’”</p>

<p>“It takes more than three generations,” answered
Leon stiffly.</p>

<p>“You mean it used to,” Monty had laughed.
“Nowadays things move faster. Why not? We put
up a two-million-dollar building in six months. We
ought to be able to make a gentleman in two generations.
I don’t know much about my family, but I
remember my father telling of the time when he
walked four miles to school in his bare feet, and so
I guess there weren’t any lords or dukes on my family
tree!”</p>

<p>“Poverty has nothing to do with it. Your father’s
father——”</p>

<p>“It has a lot to do with it nowadays,” chuckled
Monty. “Do you suppose I’d have had the courage
to come east here and butt in on these high-brows
with their silver-backed brushes and all if I hadn’t
had a gob of money behind me? Yes, I would—not!
Son, it’s having something in the old sock that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
gives you the right to shove through the crowd and
take a front seat. If my father had been George
Washington and my mother—er—Mary Antoinette,
or whatever her name was, and I didn’t have any
money, I’d just as soon thought of jumping off the
Washington Monument as coming here to school!”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense! Money has nothing to do with
it!”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit! Your folks have money. You
haven’t told me so, but your father’s a sugar dealer—factor,
you call it, don’t you?—and you dress like
a circus horse, and so I guess it’s a fair bet that they
have. All right. But just suppose they hadn’t.
Suppose you had just enough money to pay your fare
up here and back and your tuition. A lot of good
your old ancestors would do you!”</p>

<p>“I’d be just the same as I am now, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t, son! You’d be slinking
around in a suit of old clothes that you were ashamed
of and hating fellows who dressed decently. And
you’d know two or three fellows like yourself and no
one else. That’s how near you’d be to what you are
now.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a—a snob!”</p>

<p>“Maybe I talk like one, but I’m not. I don’t care
whether a fellow has money or hasn’t, and I care
just as little whether his great-grandfather or his
grandfather or his father came over with the Pilgrims
in 1500 or whenever it was, or came last Friday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
in the steerage. If a chap is square, that’s
enough for me. He doesn’t have to have silver
military brushes with monograms on ’em, and I don’t
give a hang if he says ‘ain’t’ for ‘isn’t’! Birth be
blowed!”</p>

<p>“But you make money everything!” Leon had
protested.</p>

<p>“I don’t! I make the confidence that having
money gives you everything. Gee, I’m talking like
a spell-binder at a country picnic! I don’t say that
it’s a fine thing to have money just as money, but I
say it’s a fine thing to have it for what it gets you.
If I was poor, know what I’d do?” Leon shook his
head. “Well, I’d make some money,” chuckled
Monty.</p>

<p>“There are lots of better things to do!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but you can do them better if you have
the money, son. If I wanted to be—to be a musician,
for instance, I’d make me a little pile first off.
Or if I wanted to be a statesman, or—or anything
else.”</p>

<p>“And by the time you’d got your money it would
be too late to be anything!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it! Making money isn’t
hard.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t everyone have it then?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Leon. It’s a secret, but I’ll tell it to
you. It’s because the way to make money is to work,
and a lot of folks never learned that. They think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
you have to sit down and wait for it to drop into
your pocket. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“I ‘savvy’ that you’re a perfect ass,” grumbled
Leon. “And I don’t believe you believe——”</p>

<p>“All I believe? Right you are, son! And I don’t
believe you believe that you are any better because
your great-great-grandfather was fried in oil by
Spanish inquisitors away back in 1100 B. C.”</p>

<p>“You’re strong on dates!” laughed Leon.</p>

<p>“Dates,” replied Monty untroubledly, “are as useless
as ancestors. They’re like the frills they put on
lamb chops. You can’t eat them and the chop would
taste just as well without ’em. I know that Columbus
or Amerigo Vespucci or Sebastian Cabot or some
other guy discovered America. But I don’t know
when, and I don’t care, and it doesn’t matter. And,
say, who did do it, anyway? I’ll bet it was the Vespucci
chap, because they named the country America
after him, and Columbus only got the capital of Ohio
named after <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Leon, “if that’s your argument,
the real discoverer must have been a fellow named
United States!”</p>

<small>MONTY IS BORED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monty’s day was as follows. He awoke
early, which was a habit of his and for
which he claimed no special merit, and,
propped up in bed, studied for a half-hour or, occasionally,
an hour. At seven or thereabouts he arose.
Chapel was at seven-thirty. Attendance was compulsory.
Breakfast was at eight o’clock, whether
one ate in the big dining-hall at Lothrop or the
smaller one in Manning or a tiny one in Morris or
Fuller. The first recitation was at nine and the
last at two, the hour between twelve and one being
devoted to dinner. Monty’s schedule provided him
with four hours on Mondays and Fridays, three
hours on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays
and one hour on Saturdays, the latter being from
nine to ten. When there was a spare hour between
recitations he was supposed to spend it in preparation.
If you were a member of either of the school
societies you usually ascended to the society’s
room on the top floor of School Hall and did the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
best you could in the presence of from six to twenty
others, several of whom would doubtless be playing
pool. Otherwise you went into the library or
the common room in your dormitory or retired to
your study. In Monty’s case, as Morris lay the
length of the front campus away from School Hall,
he usually affected the library. At a few minutes
before three the last class for the day was dismissed.
At three-thirty football practice began and continued
for anywhere from an hour and a quarter to an hour
and a half. After practice, twenty minutes or more
was spent in getting a shower, dressing and returning
to the room. Supper was at six. In the evening
one theoretically did as one pleased, although a
certain amount of “digging” was necessary to even
the idlest. Visits to the village after supper were
not encouraged, but one might go if one filled out
a “pass,” and had it viséd by an instructor or proctor.
That was the average program for a member
of the two middle classes. The juniors were
more restricted, and underwent an hour of compulsory
study in the evening. The seniors usually had
fewer hours of recitation during the week, with,
consequently, more free time. On Sundays every
student attended church in the morning, and could
go again in the evening if he desired. There was a
Bible class in the afternoon, and, in the evening, the
Christian Fraternity held a meeting. Both of these
were open to all members of the school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>Now, it would seem that Monty’s days were sufficiently
occupied to prevent his being bored, and yet
on the Thursday evening succeeding the defeat at
the hands of St. James he distinctly made the assertion
that he was bored. At the moment he was
lying on the window-seat in Number 14 Lothrop,
his hands under his head—he had brushed the pillows
to the floor because he disliked having his head
higher than his feet—and his gaze fixed on a spot
on the ceiling. The statement was made to no one
in particular, but was heard by Jimmy and Leon.
Dud was upstairs visiting Ordway. For a long moment
the remark brought no response. Then Leon
yawned, and:</p>

<p>“So am I,” he responded. “I wish there was
something to do.”</p>

<p>“You might dig a bit,” suggested Jimmy cheerfully.
“I’m told that digging is quite fascinating.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure your personal experience is very slight,”
said Leon. “I wish I had enough energy to tear
myself away from your scintillant society, and do
some digging, though. I’ve got a lot of Milton to
read.”</p>

<p>“Dear old John!” murmured Jimmy, stretching
his feet further across the floor from the armchair
in which he was reclining on his spine. “How well,
and, oh, how fondly I recall his beautiful poems!
Don’t you just dote on ‘L’Allegro’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“I do not,” replied Leon feelingly. “How much
of him do we have, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lots, dearie. There’s his lovely ‘Il Penseroso,’
yet, and likewise the absorbing ‘Comus.’ Milton
was a bright and cheerful writer, what?”</p>

<p>“What are you <em>hombres</em> talking about?” inquired
Monty lazily. “What other brands of cigars does
this fellow make?”</p>

<p>“Milton was not a cigarmaker,” answered Jimmy
patiently. “And the ‘Il Penseroso’ is not a five-cent
bundle of cabbage leaves. Milton was a poet.
What he made was trouble. I don’t suppose,” he
added, thoughtfully, “that Milton realized what a
heap of worry he was laying out for the upper
middle class at Grafton School, though. If he had,
he wouldn’t have written the stuff. But he couldn’t
foresee——”</p>

<p>“Of course, he couldn’t. Milton was blind.”</p>

<p>“Hello! Listen to him, Leon! He heard about
it away out in Wyoming! Wonderful the way news
travels nowadays, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Guess it’s Milton’s daughters you want to speak
to about it,” said Monty. “They could have hidden
father’s fountain pen if they’d wanted to. I’ve seen
a picture of the old gentleman dictating to one of
the girls, with two or three more standing around
and looking like they were wondering what they
could do to stop it. Do I have to wade through
that Pondoroso stuff if I make the upper middle?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
Because if I do I’m going to stay where I’m at!”</p>

<p>“I love his free and untrammeled use of the English
language,” murmured Jimmy. “‘Where I am
at’ is so expressive, isn’t it? Of course, you both
recall the Englishman who went home from a visit
to this benighted land and criticised us for saying
‘Where am I at?’ He said it should be ‘Where <em>is</em>
my ’at?’”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Monty.</p>

<p>“Why not laugh a little, then?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that the story was funny, although
it is—or was once. I meant it was funny you
should remember it. I forgot it so long ago!”</p>

<p>“Next time stop me, sweet one.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t give us a chance,” laughed Leon.</p>

<p>“Naturally. If you want to tell a funny story,
do it quick before some Smart Alick says he’s heard
it!”</p>

<p>“All this is bright and brilliant,” observed Monty,
“but it doesn’t soothe the restless longing I have for
excitement.”</p>

<p>“Wish we could go to the movies,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Might as well wish for grand opera,” responded
Leon. “What <em>can</em> we do, fellows? I’ve got it now,
too.”</p>

<p>“Why do anything?” asked Jimmy. “I’m quite
comfortable here. You chaps probably ate something
for supper that doesn’t agree with you. I
know that feeling of unrest perfectly.” He laid a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
hand tenderly on his stomach. Monty snorted with
disdain.</p>

<p>“Bet you your soul and your stomach are in the
same place, Jimmy,” he said. “If I was at home I—I’d
get on a bronc and run him about ten miles
across country. I feel—” Monty stopped.</p>

<p>“Proceed, dearie,” prompted Jimmy. “Just what
are your symptoms? Tell Uncle James.”</p>

<p>“I feel like it would do me a heap of good to take
that closet door off its hinges and slide downstairs
on it.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s an innocent diversion,” said Jimmy.
“Go to it, Monty!”</p>

<p>“Come along?” asked Monty hopefully.</p>

<p>“N-no. No, I think not, my impetuous friend.
You see, my folks rather expect me to stay here
until June. It would be an awful disappointment to
them if I appeared, bag and baggage, back at the
old home in October. Think of something—something—er—more
sub-tile.”</p>

<p>“How about going down and doing something to
Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“‘Something’ is so vague. What, for instance?
Mind you, I’m for it, because Jimmy and I don’t
love each other just now. Jimmy said things
about a comp of mine that no gentleman should
say to another. Go on, Monty. You interest me
strangely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Anything short of breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
him somewhere. Joking aside, fellows, let’s mosey
out and shoot up something. Let’s have some excitement.
I’ve been as good and quiet as a little
woolly lamb ever since I struck this outfit, and now
I’ve just got to spread myself a bit. Leon, you
think of something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Leon, let that ardent southern nature of
yours loose for a spell,” Jimmy seconded. “Unfurl—er—unleash
your vivid imagination. We hang
on your words.”</p>

<p>“We might break something,” answered Leon
thoughtfully. “A couple of windows.”</p>

<p>“With rocks?” asked Monty doubtfully. “Oh, I
know! With baseball bats! Great! Come on!”</p>

<p>“Call that sub-tile?” scoffed Jimmy. “You fellows
have no more imagination than a—than a—a
hen! You’re just naughty little boys with your
breaking windows stuff. Think up something artistic,
original.”</p>

<p>“I don’t hear you coming across with any big
ideas,” said Monty, scornfully. “Say, what <em>do</em> you
fellows do here when you want some fun?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we go up to the society rooms and play pool
or chess,” replied Jimmy sweetly. “Or we gather
about the piano downstairs and sing glees. Don’t
you just love to sing glees? And rounds? Know
that charming thing about the Three Blind Mice?
Shall we go down and sing it?”</p>

<p>“You make me sick,” groaned Monty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going home to do some studying,” said Leon
with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. “What time
is it?”</p>

<p>“About a quarter past nine, old dear. What’s
the matter with our western friend?”</p>

<p>Monty had lowered his feet to the floor, and was
gazing at Jimmy with a strangely earnest expression,
an expression absorbed and almost exalted. “Where
is this piano?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor Leon, he’s going to sing at us!”
moaned Jimmy. “Don’t tell him! Don’t tell him!”</p>

<p>But Monty was already crossing the room to the
door. “Come on,” he directed. “If we can’t break
something let’s make a noise.”</p>

<p>The common room, a big apartment on the first
floor comfortably furnished with leather-cushioned
chairs and couches and window-seats, was deserted,
but in the game room, which opened from it at one
end, a dozen boys were seated about the tables at
chess or checkers or dominoes. At the other end
of the common room was the library, a square apartment
of book-lined walls and low reading lamps, and
here a few more denizens of Lothrop were ensconced.
The evening was a trifle chilly in spite of
the warmth of the day, and a small fire flickered in
the big fireplace when Monty and Leon and Jimmy
descended on the piano. Jimmy was grinning in
anticipation of the disturbance about to be created.
There was no rule that he knew of prohibiting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
use of the piano at that hour, but he fancied the
chess players and the studious youths reclining in
the padded ease of the library armchairs would not
be especially sympathetic toward Monty’s craving
for music.</p>

<p>If any such thoughts assailed Monty, he hid the
fact. Up went the piano lid, and he ran his fingers
along the keys with a startling tri-i-ill. “Some box,”
he announced approvingly. Then he seated himself
on the bench, struck a chord resonantly, and put
his head back. In the library five books were lowered
simultaneously, and in the game room a dozen
absorbed youths stared amazedly and frowned disapproval.</p>

<small>KEYS: PIANO AND OTHERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monty had a good voice, and lots of it, a
true baritone. And he proved within a
few moments that he could, to use his own
phrase, “pound the tombstones.” He could read
easy notes, but his playing was usually by ear, and
he was not tied down by any particular method, style
or rules. Fingering may not have been one of
Monty’s strong points, but he had a good sense of
harmony and rhythm and plenty of strength! His
first offering, however, afforded him small opportunity
to prove his skill as an accompanist, for the
song required little assistance from the instrument.
Nor, for that matter, did it call for remarkable
vocal effort. It wasn’t a particularly cheerful song,
and the fact that Monty sang it in a drawling wail
made it no livelier.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, bury me out on the lone prair<em>ee</em>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The words came low and mournfully</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Oh, bury me out on the lone prair<em>ee</em>!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There was, evidently, another verse, but Jimmy
interposed. “For the love of lemons, Monty!”
he begged. “Don’t you know anything cheerful?”</p>

<p>Monty grinned, nodded and struck the keys a resounding
bang, straightened back and started off
blithely:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Only a ‘ranch hand,’ stranger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">At a dollar a day, you see;</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There’s no orange bloom on the harness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">But frost on the single-trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And the sun shows red over Baldy’s head</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">As you shiver an’ cough an’ sneeze.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Monty said there were eighteen verses in all, but
he compromised with Leon and Jimmy on eight. By
that time Monty’s audience had increased vastly.
The doorways were thronged, while a few of Jimmy’s
friends had joined him at the piano. Monty
dashed into a rollicking cowboy ditty called, “When
Rob Got Throwed”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The time when Rob got throwed</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">I thought I sure would bust!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I like to died a-laffin’</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">He crawled on that Andy bronc</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">The next thing that he knew</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">He was wallerin’ in the dirt!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Applause followed the final verse, and for the
first time Monty became aware of the size of his
audience. “Hello,” he said to the room in general.
“Want to sing something? What do they know,
Jimmy? How about ‘Sam Bas’? or ‘The Shivaree’?
or ‘Black Jack Davey’? Well, what <em>do</em> you know?”</p>

<p>But it appeared that the audience preferred to
hear more from Monty, and Monty good-naturedly
responded. The game tables were now abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
and the doorways were empty, and half a hundred
inhabitants of Lothrop had closed in around the
piano or found points of vantage near by. The big
tables, one at each end of the room, were crowded,
and swinging feet kept time to the refrains. Monty
had to ransack his memory for songs. Now and
then the listeners showed a disposition to take part
by humming a chorus, but it wasn’t until the soloist
had got halfway through “Cantankerous Charlie”
that he had the audience with him. They liked that
song, for there was a fine swing to the refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My name’s Cantankerous Charlie, and I come from over the mesa.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I never gets bust, I’ve plenty o’ dust, and I always pay my way, sir.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ve rocked the cradle and shoveled the dirt from morn till dewy night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now I’m down in this old town with a heart that’s gay and light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yip, yip! Yip, yay! I’m free to say I’m here to see the sights!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After that the concert was no longer a one-man
affair. One singer after another was pushed forward,
held a brief conference with Monty and
launched into song. After the first verse was sung
Monty was right with him. When in doubt he
“faked,” but he never went far wrong. They sang
all the popular songs of the moment, and many old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
favorites. Once, Mr. Rumford appeared unnoticed
at the door—his rooms were at the end of the corridor—and
looked and listened doubtfully. But the
hour was still early, and save that the noise was
possibly a bit excessive, the performance was violating
no rule, and the assistant principal went softly
away again.</p>

<p>At last, Monty pleaded weariness, and a senior
named Forbes took his place at the keyboard, and
they began on the school songs: “Here We Go,”
“The Scarlet and Gray,” “The Days to Memory
Dear,” and many others. Monty sifted his way
through the crowd. He had had enough, and was
ready for bed. He tried to find Leon, but that
youth was swallowed up in the throng. Fellows
near by were observing him curiously, but approvingly,
as he loitered across to the fireplace. At the
piano Forbes was making the strings hum under
the strains of “Here We Go!” and half a hundred
throats—more, perhaps, since youths returning
from the village or other dormitories had joined
the throng—were chanting the chorus. Monty
yawned. After all, singing had not altogether
quieted his craving for exciting deeds, but nothing
more promised. Unobtrusively, he left the room by
the nearer door, and climbed the stairs to Number
14 to recover his hat. As he went, the swelling refrain
followed him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Grafton! Grafton! Here we go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Arm in arm, with banners flying!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Pity, pity any foe</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">When it hears us loudly crying:</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">‘Grafton! Grafton! Rah, rah, rah!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">All together! Now the chorus:</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">‘Grafton! Grafton!——’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The words, if not the sound, failed him as he
pushed open the door of Number 14. He considered
awaiting Leon’s and Jimmy’s return, and decided
against it. Leon would probably go back to
Trow without coming back upstairs. Monty yawned
again, picked up his hat, set it askew on his head,
and started out. But the sight of the key reposing
trustfully on the inside of the door gave him an
idea. He chuckled as he withdrew it, closed the
door, inserted the key on the outside, turned it, and
pulled it out. He tried the portal and dropped the
key in his pocket. Up and down the corridor other
doors stood invitingly open, some wide, some barely
ajar. A few were closed. Monty’s idea grew to
splendid proportions. He crossed the corridor to
the nearest open portal and knocked. There was
no answer. As he had expected none, he was not
disappointed. Reaching around, he took the key
of Number 13 from the inside, transferred it to the
outside, and closed and locked the door. The key,
with its little brass disk bearing the number, joined
its fellow in Monty’s pocket. He listened, a smile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of dreamy delight on his face. They were still at
it downstairs. It would be a shame not to make a
thorough job of it, not to take advantage of such
good fortune!</p>

<p>For the next few minutes he was busy. He didn’t
hurry, and there was nothing crafty in his movements.
Quite boldly he walked to a door and
knocked. Only once did he meet a response. Then
he asked for Jimmy, was told to try Number 14,
apologized and withdrew. At the end of five minutes
twelve doors were firmly locked and twelve
keys jingled merrily in Monty’s pocket. Whereupon,
crooning softly and happily, he descended the
stairway at the south end of the building, and, carefully
avoiding the common room, let himself out
into the night.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So I went and fetched him back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">But I was feelin’ good all day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For I sure enough do love to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">A feller to git throwed that way!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Monty jingled the keys in his pocket in soft accompaniment
to his triumphant song as he walked
toward the corner of the building. But having
reached the corner, he paused in the shadow there.
The question confronting him was what to do with
the keys. They were no use to him, were heavy
in his pocket, and made a noise as he walked. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
ought to be, he reflected, an appropriate place to
deposit them. But he didn’t see one that he favored
until his gaze fell on the lighted and open window
of a room close at hand. It was the corner room
in the building, and, as he determined when he had
softly pushed his way through the branches of the
shrubs between walk and building, was evidently a
study.</p>

<p>It was more elaborately furnished than other
studies Monty had seen, and the pictures on the
walls were rather more “classy.” A light on a
big mahogany writing table was turned low under
its green shade. Best of all, the apartment was
deserted. By standing close to it, and rising on
his tiptoes he could stretch his hand through the
window and reach the top of a small cabinet which
stood against the wall at the right. The top of the
cabinet was already occupied by various small articles,
but they could be pushed aside. Monty listened
and looked. No one was in sight, and, save
for the subdued din of the singers in the common
room, all was silent. In a moment the booty was
disposed of. One key fell to the floor with an
alarming rattle, but nothing happened in consequence.
Monty withdrew noiselessly, got cautiously
back to the path, and proceeded on his way home
across the campus. He met no one, and a few minutes
later climbed the stairs of Morris and entered
his room looking as innocent as a cherub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>At the washstand, Alvin Standart was sopping a
sponge against his nose and sniffling weirdly.
Monty gazed delightedly.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said. “Who gave it to you?”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” replied Alvin, sniffling between syllables.
“It’s just a nose-bleed. I have them sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured Monty, disappointedly. “What
for?”</p>

<p>“What for?” echoed Alvin in disgust. “Because
I can’t help it, you fresh chump.”</p>

<p>Monty pondered that, looking on interestedly
while Alvin continued his efforts to stop the
hemorrhage. Finally, “Look here,” he said, “isn’t
there something you do for it? Seems to me I’ve
heard of something. Let’s see. I know! You put
a lump of ice on the back of the neck or against the
spine. That’s it. And if you haven’t any ice you
use something cold, like a—paper-knife.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t any ice,” grumbled Alvin.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit. A knife will do, or—here’s the very
thing!” Monty’s inquiring hands had encountered
a key in his pocket, and he drew it forth triumphantly.
“Here you are. Hold that against the
back of your neck, like that.”</p>

<p>“Ouch! It’s cold!”</p>

<p>“Sure! It ought to be. Got it? All you’ve got
to do is to hold it there until your nose stops bleeding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“Well—well, suppose it doesn’t? Think I’m going
to stand here all night holding this thing?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” answered Monty cheerfully. “You
don’t expect me to do it, do you? Couldn’t you
sit down and hold it?”</p>

<p>“No, because I’ve used up all the handkerchiefs
I’ve got and— Oh, gee!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Monty, looking
up from his work of removing his shoes.</p>

<p>“It’s gone.”</p>

<p>“The nose-bleed? Good!”</p>

<p>“No, you fool, the key! It dropped down my
back.” Alvin squirmed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“You should have held on to it. You see, the
well-known law of gravity——”</p>

<p>Alvin sniffed. “You and your silly old key,” he
growled.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to be glad it wasn’t a lump of
ice,” responded Monty soothingly. “There’s a
bright side to every cloud, Standart.” Monty
dropped his shoes and began undressing. Alvin
viewed him aggrievedly from the washstand.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you ever heard of stopping nose-bleed
with a key,” he said, suspiciously. “<em>I</em> never
did.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty poor reasoning, partner. About
how long will you be camping around that basin?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess I’m through with it now,” answered
Alvin. “I think it’s stopped.” He sniffed experimentally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
blew his nose gently, and said, “Humph!”
in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>“There you are! Next time, <em>hombre</em>, you’ll believe
in my remedies, eh? Would you very much
mind removing the basin to the bathroom, and obliterating
the evidences of carnage? Give it a good
cleaning while you’re at it.”</p>

<p>When Alvin returned he set about disrobing, and
in the course of the operation the key which had
slipped down his back fell with a tinkle to the floor.
Alvin picked it up, and observed it curiously. “Say,
where’d you get this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Get what? Oh, that key? I don’t know. Let’s
see it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a dormitory key,” said Alvin. “It says ‘8’
on it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I—happened on it. Toss it over. I dare
say some chap dropped it.” Monty put it in his
trousers pocket, with a fine show of ease, but as he
went back to bed, and settled down for slumber he
wondered how he had missed it when he had emptied
his pockets of the others, and blamed himself
severely for his carelessness.</p>

<small>STANDART GETS ADVICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monty encountered Jimmy the next morning
in front of School Hall. Jimmy was
one of a dozen youths awaiting the nine
o’clock bell on the steps. It was a brisk morning
in the last week of October, but here in the sunlight
it was comfortably warm. Jimmy disengaged himself
from Ned Musgrave and Nick Blake, with
whom he had been talking, and sauntered out to
intercept Monty. He had a quizzical smile on his
face as he thrust a hand under Monty’s arm, and
turned him along the brick wall.</p>

<p>“Fine morning, Monty,” he observed blandly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“No reason at all, no reason at all. I’m glad
it is. I’m glad for your sake.”</p>

<p>Monty gazed around over the turf. “I didn’t
know loco weed grew in these parts,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Because,” proceeded Jimmy, “it’s nice to have
pleasant recollections of a place. You’ll remember
Grafton as you see it today, Monty, with the sunlight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
gilding the façades of our noble buildings, and
the autumn sky blue overhead——”</p>

<p>“I like it rhymed better. There’s more swing
to it. This ‘free verse’ stuff——”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’ll look back on this fair morning, and
say, ‘Ah, them was the “halcyon” days!’ You’ll remember
the school at its best, Monty.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to. I’m in no hurry, but it’s about two
minutes to nine, and maybe you’d better get down
to cases, partner.”</p>

<p>“What train have you decided on?” asked Jimmy
solicitously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going away, am I? That’s the idea.
Well, shoot, Jimmy!”</p>

<p>“Don’t pretend innocence, Monty. In the words
of our best playwrights, ‘All is discovered!’”</p>

<p>“Who’s Hall?” inquired the other interestedly.</p>

<p>“He’s the <em>key</em> to the situation,” chuckled Jimmy.
“Say, it was all right, Monty. I give you that. It
was some circus while it lasted. Where you made
one mistake was not to stick around and watch the
fun. You ought to have heard the howls!” Jimmy
laughed gleefully. “We spent about half an hour
trying to fit keys from the upper corridor rooms before
someone got sore and hiked down to ‘Jimmy’
Rumford, and told his troubles. Then ‘Jimmy’ sent
for Mr. Craig, and Craig had gone to bed, and
after he came he couldn’t find which was the right
passkey, and there was the dickens generally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” drawled Monty, “I’m supposed to
know what you’re talking about?”</p>

<p>Jimmy winked slowly. “You are. Bixby recognized
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know him personally, but I’ve used his
blacking.”</p>

<p>“You put your head in his room and asked for
me, you idiot. That was a crazy thing to do. But
they say criminals always fall down somewhere on
the job.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was Bixby, was it? And he up and
spoke a piece?”</p>

<p>“Not Bix! Bix is all right. He told me in
confidence, and you can depend on his keeping
mum.”</p>

<p>“I always liked his blacking,” said Monty gratefully.
“Well, then, why the stampede? Why look
up trains, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Because Rumford’s hopping, tearing mad, darling.
Says you—meaning whoever did it—tried to
fasten the crime on him. He’s gone and told Charley.
Says he will find the culprit if he has to question
every fellow in school. He will, too. He’s
like that. All the—er—tenacity of a bulldog; without
his forgiving disposition. That was mistake
number two, old dear. ‘Anyone but Jimmy’ should
have been your motto.”</p>

<p>The nine o’clock bell rang, and Jimmy turned
back along the path. But Monty grabbed him. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
guess I’m sort of boneheaded, Jimmy,” he said, “but
kindly tell me where Rumford comes in on it. What
did I do to him, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“What did you do to him?” demanded the other
incredulously as he led the pace back to School Hall.
“Why, you triple-ply, self-starting idiot, you dumped
the keys on his table!”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>”</p>

<p>“Sure! Didn’t you know it? Didn’t you mean
to?”</p>

<p>Monty shook his head weakly as they stumbled
up the steps, and Jimmy gave way to a gale of
laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s great!” he gurgled. “Monty, you’re
a wonder! You—you——”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” whispered the other. “Don’t sing
about it! How much does Old Whiskers know?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—yet. But watch out for trouble,
dearie. And, say, if you still have the key to Number
8 go and drop it in the river. It’s the only
one that wasn’t found, and having it on you will
be just about as safe as carrying a stick of dynamite.
See you at eleven, Monty. Come up to the
room.”</p>

<p>Jimmy darted off down the corridor, leaving
Monty to climb the stairs to a Latin recitation. As
he went his right hand clutched tightly a brass key
and tag at the bottom of a pocket. He feared it
might jingle!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“What gets me,” said Jimmy later, as they sat
in Number 14, “is why Charley didn’t spring something
about it in chapel this morning. He must
have known by then, because he and ‘Jimmy’ were
talking together when Dud and I went in. Maybe
he’s going to do some detective work, and find
that Number 8 key. I say, you don’t know where
it got to, eh?”</p>

<p>Monty hesitated. Then he nodded.</p>

<p>“You do? Where is it? You haven’t got it still,
I hope!”</p>

<p>“It’s best for you not to know, Jimmy,” replied
Monty gravely. “What you don’t know won’t hurt
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, but, for the love of lemons,
Monty, get rid of it if you have it! If it got found
on you—or in your room—or anywhere—” Jimmy
was quite breathless.</p>

<p>“I’d have to look up another school, eh? Why
is it, Jimmy, that Fate knocks me around the way
it does? I want to lead a quiet and peaceful life,
but I’m not let. I’m a regular tumble-weed. Look
at the way things happened at Dunning.”</p>

<p>“But you told us you deliberately fired yourself,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why? I was bored, just as I was last
night. I needed excitement, and there wasn’t any,
and so, of course, I had to find it. But it isn’t my
fault, is it? I guess it’s my evil genius,” said Monty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
sadly. “The real A Monty Crail is a quiet, peace-loving
<em>hombre</em>, but——”</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed. “The trouble with you, old
scout, is that you need more room than you get at
prep school. You’re a child of the boundless west,
eh, what?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Anyhow, I’ve had a good time so far.
I’d be sorry to lose football, though. Look here,
how’s Old Whiskers going to fasten the childish
prank on me as long as you and Bixby keep your
ears down?”</p>

<p>“I’m hoping he won’t,” said Jimmy. “But he’s
a determined old codger, and if there’s any sort of
a clue he will find it as sure as shooting. At that,
though, you might not get anything more than probation.”</p>

<p>“What’s that do to you?” asked Monty anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, it keeps you out of athletics, for one thing.
And you have to stick around the school, and can’t
go off, and you stay in your dormitory every evening
after six o’clock, and you have to get up and
stay up in all your studies. And if you make one
false move faculty is on you like a ton of bricks.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked the other sarcastically.
“They don’t draw and quarter you, then?”</p>

<p>“It’s better than being dropped, though,” responded
Jimmy philosophically. “If you’re on pro
you can get reinstated again, but if you’re expelled—good
night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“I would just as soon get fired as go on probation,”
said Monty. “Anyway, what’s the good of
worrying about it? If Old Whiskers gets me, why,
he gets me, and that’s all there is to it. Maybe,
after all, I wasn’t intended to mingle with you high-brows.
Maybe one of those catch-as-catch-can
schools out our way would be more my style. Might
as well be cheerful, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure! ‘Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow
we diet,’ as the poet so beautifully hath it.”</p>

<p>“Did the fellows notice the fact that I left before
the party was over?” asked Monty.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so. I didn’t know you had
gone until we stopped yelping. Leon was looking
for you, too. If Bixby doesn’t talk, and he promised
he wouldn’t, I don’t see that ‘Jimmy’ has much of a
show. Of course, if he gets to asking all the fellows
he might stumble on something to put him
wise.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t be likely to ask any fellows outside
Lothrop, would he?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. Why?”</p>

<p>“I just wondered.”</p>

<p>“Come across. What are you wondering about?
Did someone see you up here?”</p>

<p>“Only Bixby. But—well, the silly part of it’s
this. I didn’t know I’d missed one of those keys
when I dumped them through that window. I suppose
I dropped it in another pocket. Anyway, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
I got back to Morris, that Indian, Standart, had a
nose-bleed——”</p>

<p>“Who handed it to him?” asked Jimmy, eagerly.</p>

<p>Monty shook his head. “That’s what I hoped,
but it wasn’t so. He just has ’em for fun. Well,
I remembered that if you put something cold
against the back of your neck you generally stopped
it. I mean the nose-bleed. So I did the Good
Samaritan act and fished out a key——”</p>

<p>“You howling idiot!”</p>

<p>“Take the money, Jimmy. I didn’t think anything
about it being one of those keys; didn’t stop
to think that it <em>was</em> a key, I guess; and Standart
got hold of it, and wanted to know how I came
by it.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him you found it?”</p>

<p>“Something of the sort. I tried to be careless
about it, but——”</p>

<p>“It’s all up, dearie! Still, maybe Standart won’t
peep, eh?”</p>

<p>“Won’t he?” said Monty grimly. “He hates me
like he hates soap and water, and that’s some hate!
I didn’t know last night that I’d gone and put the
keys in Rumford’s room or that there’d be all this
fuss about it. If I had I’d have made Standart
promise not to squeal. Now, I guess it’s too late.
He’s probably talked it all over the school.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” groaned Jimmy. “Say, you are
one fine little criminal, aren’t you? Look here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
though, Monty, why don’t you go and find Standart
and see if he’s blabbed? There’s always the chance
that he hasn’t. And <em>if</em> he hasn’t—” Jimmy paused
eloquently. “You might be able to convince him
that it would be a lot more healthy to forget
it!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better,” agreed Monty, reaching for
his hat. “It may just be that he hasn’t connected
that key with the little affair yet.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bank on that, old dear. Standart’s no
fool, if he is an ass. He knows, all right, all right,
but he may be chewing it over and thinking out the
best way to spring his little piece. Get after him
and buy him off or scare him to death.”</p>

<p>“Buy him off!” said Monty scornfully. “I
wouldn’t bargain with the beast. But I might show
him two mighty good reasons for keeping quiet!”</p>

<p>Monty didn’t overtake Alvin until dinner-time.
Then he encountered him on his way downstairs to
the table. During the meal, during which the practical
joke played on the second floor residents of
Lothrop was the main subject of conversation,
Monty cast many appraising glances across the
board at his roommate without, however, being able
to decide how much Alvin knew or guessed. At
least, he offered no light on the problem that interested
the gathering, which was who had had the
beautiful effrontery to put those keys on Mr. Rumford’s
cabinet. Monty gathered that it would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
been far less rash to have rung Doctor Duncan’s
doorbell and handed the keys to a maid with his
compliments!</p>

<p>When dinner was over Monty trailed Alvin to
the front steps. It almost seemed that the latter
was aware of Monty’s espionage, for he appeared
to take especial pains to avoid him. He sat down,
and entered the conversation that was going on,
while Monty grimly stood watch in the doorway.
One by one, however, the other fellows got up and
went indoors or wandered away toward the campus,
and Alvin, finding himself threatened with being
left alone with Monty, arose, too, and started
upstairs. Monty followed him leisurely, and
reached the next floor only in time to prevent Alvin
from dodging into Number G.</p>

<p>“I want to see you a minute,” he said, laying a
persuasive hand on Alvin’s shoulder. “Just a minute,
<em>hombre</em>. Come on in here.”</p>

<p>Alvin expostulated haughtily, but evidently didn’t
care to make a physical issue of it, and followed
the other into F. Monty closed the door. Then he
thrust his hands into his pockets—the right coming
into startling contact with that horrible key—and
faced his roommate. Alvin was eyeing him at once
slyly and defiantly.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I want to give you some advice, partner,” replied
Monty gravely. “If you know something you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
think faculty would like to hear it’ll pay you best
to forget all about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean!”</p>

<p>“I think you do, son. And my advice to you is:
Don’t do it! Because if I found that faculty had
learned something unpleasant about me I’d hitch it
right up to you, and then, if it was the last act of
my young and blameless career, I’d everlastingly
wallop you, <em>hombre</em>. Sprinkle that on your oats
and chew it!”</p>

<p>“If I did know anything,” blustered Alvin, “your
threats wouldn’t keep me quiet. Not if I wanted
to tell. I’m not saying, though, whether I know
anything or not.” He smirked. “Maybe I do, and
maybe I don’t. That’s for you to find out.”</p>

<p>“Whether you do or don’t isn’t worrying me,
Standart. I’m only giving you fair warning that
if you talk you’ll wish you hadn’t. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of you, you blow-hard! I’ll do
just as I please. Maybe if I wanted to I could tell
Mr. Rumford something that would interest him,
though.”</p>

<p>“So you do know, eh?” asked Monty grimly. He
began to get out of his coat. <a href="#i_fp164">“Then I guess you’ve
already squealed, and I’d better——”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp164">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_165">“Then I guess you’ve already squealed, and I’d better——”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I haven’t!” protested Alvin, moving hurriedly
around the table. “Give you my word I haven’t,
Crail!”</p>

<p>“Sure?” Alvin nodded vehemently. “Well, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
you going to? Because, if you are, you might as
well have it right now while I’m feeling in the right
mood. Are you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said I knew anything,” hedged the
other. “And you can’t lick me for something I
haven’t done. And—and I’d like to know what
I’d be doing all the time! I’m not afraid of you,
you big bully!”</p>

<p>“I’m no bigger than you are, and I’m nearly a
year younger,” replied Monty, “but I sure can lick
you, and I mean to do it the very first time you
make a yip. I mean that, Standart. Remember
this, <em>hombre</em>; if you tell anything you know or think
you know it will be good-by for me, and when it
is good-by I shan’t care a hang what I do, because
I’ll be pulling my freight anyway. Now,
you think that over, and if you think hard you’ll
decide to keep your ears flat down to your head,
son.”</p>

<p>Monty pulled his coat back into place, and Alvin,
seeing that instant punishment was not his doom, recovered
his sang-froid. He smiled contemptuously,
and snapped his long fingers.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you guessing, haven’t I, Mr. Smart
Alick?” he asked. “And I’ll keep you guessing,
too,” he chuckled. “When things are going along
their nicest, Crail, you just remember that I’m still
around with a tongue in my head. I make no promises,
understand. I’ve got you where I want you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
and I’ll keep you there as long as it pleases me to!
Now <em>you</em> do some thinking!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, <em>hombre</em>,” replied Monty. “Just
remember what I’ve said. There’s no time-limit
set.”</p>

<p>After that, Monty sauntered across to School
Hall, and, being quite alone in the corridor, hung
the key of Number 8 Lothrop to a tack on the notice
board.</p>

<small>THE MIDDLETON GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That was on Friday, and on Saturday morning
Monty waited with mingled feelings of
curiosity and uneasiness for Doctor Duncan
to make an announcement in chapel regarding the
matter of the stolen keys. Jimmy Logan was quite
as alert, and Leon was plainly anxious. But to the
surprise of each, and of the school in general, no
mention was made of the affair. Faculty was treating
it with bland unconcern, or so it would seem to
one less used to the ways of faculty than James
Townsend Logan. Jimmy was pessimistic after
chapel, and on the way across to Lothrop made the
fact known.</p>

<p>“I’d like it a good deal better,” he said, “if Charley
had come out in the open and talked about it.
It just proves that Rumford is doing some of his
gum-shoe work, and doesn’t want to—to frighten
the criminals. ‘Jimmy’ is all right, but he fancies
himself a bit as a ‘detecative.’ Still, he doesn’t always
make good. Last year, for instance. Remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
how he sleuthed around to find out who started
that Junior Meeting Riot, Dud?” Dud nodded.
“Well, he fell down hard on that.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” said Dud. “Most fellows
thought the reason faculty didn’t jump someone was
because it was afraid it would have to jump half
the school. Some fellows did get pro, didn’t they?
Hobo Ordway——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ordway got caught trying to sneak into hall
after lock-up. Some lower middlers shut him up in
a room in School Hall, and he had to climb down
a rain-spout or something, and Wallace Cathcart,
who was proctor then, nabbed him. That wasn’t
any feather in ‘Jimmy’s’ cap. Just the same, I wish
they’d come out, and say things and not scare us
to death with this Secret Service stunt. I met ‘Jimmy’
in the corridor this morning, and he looked too
blamed innocent and sweet for anything! Bet you
he’s got a clue—or thinks he has!”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the good of letting it spoil your
entire day?” asked Monty, snuggling down into the
neck of his sweater philosophically. “I didn’t do
anything much, after all. It was a perfectly harmless
joke. If Jimmy wants to be nasty, why, that’s
up to him. I’m enjoying a perfectly clear conscience.”</p>

<p>“If only you hadn’t let that pig of Standart get
wise,” mourned Leon. “Couldn’t we get him into
a canoe and spill him out in the river? He doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
look like a chap who knows how to swim.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stake my claim he doesn’t,” agreed Monty.
“He hates water too much ever to learn swimming!
Well, I’m going to breakfast. See you later, fellows.
I’ll be up at eleven, Leon.”</p>

<p>They parted in front of Lothrop, Jimmy, Dud
and Leon entering the building to seek the dining
hall, and Monty setting out briskly for Morris. It
was a cold, nippy morning, and he thought pleasantly
of the cup of coffee that awaited him, and
hoped that he would not be too late to get his full
share of Mother Morris’s hot biscuits or muffins.
That affair of the keys dwindled into insignificance
beside the far more important matter of breakfasting.</p>

<p>That afternoon there was a lay-off for the first
team men, and, in consequence, the substitutes held
the middle of the stage. Monty ought to have been
so depressed and anxious as to have no heart for
football, but just the opposite was true. After Williams
had played against the second team for one
twelve-minute period, Monty was summoned to take
his place at right guard, and proved the nearest
thing to a sensation that the afternoon developed.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that Monty played a dazzling game,
exactly, for he didn’t. But he showed such an improvement
over his previous efforts that even Coach
Bonner was surprised. Monty was still lacking the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
finer points of the position, but today he went on
a regular rampage, and inside of two minutes from
the blowing of the whistle had Luderus, playing opposite
him on the second, putting in the hardest
afternoon of his experience. Luderus was a big,
beetle-browed, tow-haired youth of eighteen, as
strong as an ox, and much better natured. He was
very generally known as “Old Ludicrous,” and today
Monty nearly succeeded in making the nickname
fit him! The day was an ideal football day, windless,
gray and cold, and Monty felt particularly
good. As a result, Coach Crowley was forever hovering
around Luderus and berating him.</p>

<p>“Get into him, Luderus! He’s making you look
like a fool! Get the jump on him, man! Watch
his arms! Don’t let him swing you like that! Now,
then, hold!”</p>

<p>On the other side of the line, Coach Bonner frequently
called commendation to Monty. “Good
work, Crail! That’s the stuff! Put him out and
keep him out! Go on, you’re doing well!”</p>

<p>After the first five or six minutes, Luderus evened
matters better, but more than once when the substitutes
had the ball, Monty dug a clear hole for
the runner through the left side of the enemy’s line.
It was a fine contest while it lasted, with each boy
fighting hard for supremacy, giving and receiving
hard knocks, but keeping his temper through it all.
The fourth period witnessed the vanquishment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
both Monty and Luderus, for they literally played
themselves out, and were sent off together to make
way for fresh material. They walked side by side
to the field house, still panting from their exertions,
and talked the conflict over in a wonderfully detached
manner. Luderus was inclined to acknowledge
defeat, but Monty wouldn’t hear of it.</p>

<p>“Snakes, Luderus, I don’t know half what you
know about playing guard. The only reason we
had such an even thing of it was because I felt like
a two-year-old today, and managed to get the jump
on you. I dare say tomorrow you’d run rings
around me. Why, I’m no football player! I’d like
to be, but I guess I don’t quite savvy it.”</p>

<p>“Keep on the way you’re going,” chuckled “Old
Ludicrous,” “and you will find yourself holding
down a job on the first next year. You’re coming
back, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is, I am, if they’ll let me.”</p>

<p>“This is my last,” said the other, rather solemnly.
“I’ve played three years here, and the best I’ve
done is make the second two years. Suppose it
doesn’t much matter, though. A fellow has a pretty
good time on the second. Football’s football, no
matter where you play it. Well, hope we’ll have
another go at it, Crail, some day. You’re a good
fellow to play against.” Luderus went off to his
locker, leaving Monty suddenly aware that he was
extremely tired, and very sore in many places!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>Grafton went off the next day to play Middleton
School, and Monty found himself one of the party
that set out by barge, after an early dinner, for
the railway station. There was no especial honor
to be claimed because of the fact, for Coach Bonner
was taking pretty much the entire squad. But
Monty was glad, and hoped he would have a chance
to work off some of the stiffness that was his portion
today. Half the school made the trip with the
team, and supplied enough enthusiasm to have won
a dozen contests.</p>

<p>Middleton was only forty-four miles distant, but,
what with a delay at Needham Junction, and a consequent
late arrival at their destination, the Grafton
team and supporters reached the scene of battle
a scant four minutes before the time set for the
start of the game.</p>

<p>Practice was necessarily short for the visitors,
and at five minutes past the scheduled time, Pete
Gowen kicked off for Grafton. The latter began
the game with her strongest line-up, for her adversary
was reputed to be a very clever team. Derry
was at left end, and Tray at right, the tackles were
Spalding and Hanrihan, the guards Kinley and
Gowen, and Musgrave was at center. Behind the
line, Captain Winslow was in his place at left half,
with Ordway beside him, and Nick Blake at quarter.
The only second-choice player was Caner, playing
fullback in place of Manson, who had hurt his knee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
in practice three days before. As the game progressed
many substitutions were made, but with the
single exception noted, Grafton started out at her
best.</p>

<p>Middleton had a particularly puzzling, and successful
protection for the runner at the kick-off, and
swept the ball back into the middle of the field in
spite of her opponent’s efforts to penetrate the interference.
After that, Middleton apparently set out
to capture the game then and there, and came measurably
near doing it. From their forty-five yards
to Grafton’s twenty-three they took the pigskin,
using bewildering runs outside tackles that, for the
time at least, the Scarlet-and-Gray could neither
solve nor stop. Only once was the home team in
danger of losing the ball during that advance, and
that was when, on the thirty-yard-line, a runner
tripped over his own feet, and the tape had to be
brought in to determine the distance. The matter
of an inch or so gave Middleton her first down, however.
After that, she plugged the line, and reached
the twelve yards in six downs. There, after two
attempts with no gain, she tried a field-goal, and,
although the kicker stood well inside the twenty-yard-line,
made a horrible mess of the attempt, the
ball being blocked and captured by Hanrihan on his
nineteen yards. Winslow kicked on second down,
and the battle surged back to midfield.</p>

<p>Middleton again tried her running plays, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
made shorter gains now. Grafton got the ball on
downs near her thirty-yard-line and started toward
the distant goal. Plugging brought her past the
center of the field and two wide runs by Caner
put the pigskin down on the enemy’s thirty-four.
Then an attempted forward-pass went into the
wrong hands and Middleton punted, and the quarter
ended.</p>

<p>The second period was Grafton’s all the way, but
although she got to within fifteen yards of the goal
a fumble by Caner just when things looked brightest
and the Grafton contingent was shouting loudest
saved the home team. The second quarter ended
in a punting duel in which neither side showed any
superiority, although Middleton’s skill in running
the ball back gave her the best of the argument.
Middleton had caught on her thirty-five yards when
the whistle blew.</p>

<p>When the second half began it was seen that Bellows
had taken Derry’s place at left end and James
was substituting Spalding at left tackle. Middleton
had favored that end of the Grafton line in her
runs, and with good results. The change worked
well, James proving much harder to fool than
Spalding had been. Grafton got the ball on her ten
yards at the kick off and Ordway took it back seven
before he was spilled. The same back made four
through tackle on a delayed play and Caner was
stopped in his tracks. Winslow punted to the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
forty-five yards. Middleton tried the Grafton
right end and made three, but was stopped for a
loss on the next attempt at the same place. She got
through left guard for four and then faked a kick
and made her distance on a double pass that caught
Grafton’s right side napping. Two more gains gave
her another six yards and then she punted over the
line.</p>

<p>From the twenty yards, Winslow got clean away
for twelve and followed it up with four more.
Caner tried the center and made no gain. Bellows
pulled in three on an end-around play. Caner again
failed and Winslow punted. Middleton misjudged
the ball and Ordway fell on it on the enemy’s twenty-seven.
Grafton’s supporters implored a touchdown
and the Scarlet-and-Gray team set out to give them
what they asked for. Two delayed-passes put the
pigskin on the twenty, Blake gaining four and Winslow
three. Ordway was stopped for a short gain
near the side line, but Winslow made the distance on
a short-side plunge. Time was called for a Middleton
player and the home team made two alterations
in her line. Ordway carried the ball on a wide end
run to a point opposite the goal but without much
gain. Caner faked a forward-pass and tossed the
ball to Winslow for a try at center. Winslow got
through for seven and put the pigskin just back of
the ten-yard-line. Caner got two off right tackle,
Ordway failed to gain and Winslow dropped back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
to kicking distance. But with only eight to go on the
third down, the kick didn’t materialize, nor did Middleton
expect it to. Winslow threw forward to
Tray and the latter fell across the line for the first
score. Caner failed at goal.</p>

<p>Grafton’s second score came three minutes later.
Ordway made thirty-two yards on the run back
after the kick-off and put the ball on his own forty-four
yards. Longley went in for Musgrave at center
and Brunswick took Captain Winslow’s place at
left halfback for Grafton. On the next play Brunswick
got clear through the right of the Middleton
line and romped to her thirty-six before he was
pulled down. A forward-pass paved the way for
the next touchdown and Ordway took the ball across
from the twelve yards in three plunges. Brunswick
kicked an easy goal.</p>

<p>The period ended a minute later and the teams
changed places.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<small>MONTY GOES OVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Coach Bonner ran in five substitutes,
Bowen at right guard, Peet at right tackle,
Hanser at right half, Barnes at full and
Weston at quarter. Monty, one of the blanket-wrapped
line on the bench, witnessed Bowen’s departure
for the trampled battle field with disappointment.
He had been hoping that Mr. Bonner
would decide on him for the place. But Bowen was
an old hand and a better player, and, in spite of disappointment,
Monty acknowledged the wisdom of
the coach’s choice. Kinley was still holding down
the right guard position and would certainly come
out before long, but when he did there was Hersum
ready, or, if not Hersum, then Little. Monty
couldn’t see where he came into it today.</p>

<p>Middleton made no more changes in her line-up.
Grafton’s new backfield worked less smoothly than
the old and the last quarter was but three plays old
when Hanser was driven far back when attempting
a wide end run and there pulled to earth by two desperate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
opponents. It was then fourth down, with
nearly eighteen to go, and Weston kicked from close
behind the line. The ball was sent away too low
and a Middleton forward knocked it down and most
of the twenty-two players went after it. When it
finally came to a stop it was smuggled under the
canvas jacket of a Middleton tackle on Grafton’s
eighteen yards.</p>

<p>It was the home team’s time to celebrate. A fine
hubbub broke forth in the stand and along one side
of the field as the two teams lined up almost under
the shadow of the north goal. Grafton made a desperate
defence of that goal, but some of the second-string
fellows were found wanting. She staved off
that touchdown as long as she could and twice the
distance had to be measured, but in the end—it took
Middleton her full allowance of eight plays to do it—an
obnoxious halfback bored through and when
the tangle of squirming bodies was pulled or hurled
aside he was found to have placed the ball just two
inches over the line!</p>

<p>An equally obnoxious tackle added another point
to the six and Grafton kicked off to Middleton.
There was still something like eight minutes of the
period remaining and the Grafton supporters had
lost their feeling of security. Middleton came back
hard. In the first mix-up Weston was hurt and
Blake came back to quarter. Middleton began at
the wings again and tried hard to reach scoring distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
of the Scarlet-and-Gray’s goal. Several plays
netted good gains, but a fumble and a penalty equalized
matters. A desperately long forward-pass that
ought never to have succeeded did succeed and again
Grafton found herself almost under her goal. The
Middleton rooters were cheering and shouting
wildly now. Coach Bonner sent Musgrave back to
center and Winslow to left half. Another forward
heave struck the ground. Middleton began a hard
battering of the right side of the enemy’s line and
made short gains there. Grafton held fast on her
twenty-one yards and kicked on second down. Middleton
started back from the middle of the field and
came fast. An end run went around Bellows for a
dozen yards and Bowen was punctured again for
six. Hanrihan stopped the next attack and sustained
injuries. Gordon replaced him. A forward-pass
netted a short gain for Middleton and then the fullback
banged at Bowen again and romped through
for first down.</p>

<p>Monty, watching dubiously, heard his name called.
Mr. Bonner was curling a finger toward him. “Go
on in,” said the coach briefly. “Send Bowen out.
You can stop those gains if you get the jump, Crail.
Tell Blake to play his backfield deeper on the
shifts. Keep your eyes open, Crail, and show your
mettle.”</p>

<p>The coach shoved him toward the field and Monty
hurried in, pulling his head protector down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“Report to the referee,” cautioned Tray as he
passed, and Monty sought that official.</p>

<p>“Right guard, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>“All right, Crail,” greeted Winslow breathlessly.
“Who’s off?”</p>

<p>“Bowen. Where’s Blake?”</p>

<p>“Here! What is it?” And then, when Monty
had delivered his message: “All right,” he said.
“Come on now, Grafton! Get down and under ’em
and heave ’em back! Let’s take that ball away!”</p>

<p>Monty stepped in between Musgrave and Gordon
and faced his opponent, a square-shouldered youth
with a dirt-stained face and a grimly set mouth.
Middleton tried him out on the first play and Monty
proved that time no better than Bowen. But the
secondary defence backed up and the gain was short.
Then an end run was stopped for a loss.</p>

<p>“Watch this, Tom!” counseled Winslow. “Look
out on the right there! <em>Get that man!</em>” The attack
on the line was a fake and the quarter was stealing
out on the left, looking for an opening. Monty
shook himself free of the mêlée and started across
in the wake of Gordon. Tray was out of it now
and the Middleton interference swept in. Gordon
went down, taking his attacker with him, and Monty,
stumbling over the two forms, strained for the runner.
Winslow was beside him, and it was Winslow
who made the tackle. Down went the runner like a
keg of nails, the Grafton captain’s arms closing like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
vises about his legs. Monty had slewed aside and
had poised himself to drop in front of the runner
when something big and dirty-brown leaped in front
of him. It was the ball. It bounded once erratically
and then Monty had it, had tucked it into the crook
of his left arm, had wheeled and was leaping up the
field.</p>

<p>But the enemy hedged him in and he had scarcely
struck his gait when the first striped-legged player
dove at him. Monty swerved, stumbled, but got by.
Then the enemy were all about him, it seemed, and
he could only clutch the ball more desperately and
wait for the tackle, meanwhile, however, plunging
straight ahead, right arm thrusting at eager bodies,
grimly resolved to gain every inch possible before he
went crashing to earth. Cries of friend and foe
arose about it. One of his own men leaped in front
of him, smashed into a Middleton player and went
down. Monty leaped over the writhing legs, tore
loose from hands that tried to grasp his knees, staggered
and recovered. Before him was open field,
but behind him came pounding feet.</p>

<p>Not until that instant did he measure the distance
that lay between him and success. The play had
begun near Grafton’s twenty-five-yard line and
Monty had captured the ball at about the twenty.
Now he was crossing the thirty-five, and nearly two-thirds
of the field stretched before him. He was no
sprinter, was Monty, but he could set a good pace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
and keep it up for a long while, and now he had the
advantage of being fresh and untired. His leg and
back muscles had felt stiff and sore when he had
trotted onto the field a few moments since, but he
had quickly forgotten the fact, and now it was only
a knowledge of his inability to run fast that troubled
him. Had he been Winslow or Ordway or Nick
Blake he might have left the pack behind without
much difficulty, but as it was he feared every moment
to feel arms wrap themselves about him. He dared
not look back directly, but, near the forty-five yards,
he stole a sidewise glace. A confusion of moving
bodies rewarded the fleeting look. He got the impression
that one was dangerously near and the rest
well behind. He was heading straight for the goal-posts,
and in doing so, since he had started his race
from well toward the side of the gridiron, he was,
perhaps, giving his pursuers a slight advantage,
traveling a few feet further than they in case they
had begun the pursuit nearer the middle of the field.
The difference could be only slight as to distance,
but it might mean just the fraction of a second that
would defeat him. He straightened his course and
no longer focussed eager eyes on the goal. Breathing
hurt him now and the muscles down the front of
his legs ached as he forced himself on at a pace he
had never before attempted.</p>

<p>He was well past the middle of the field before he
heard the shouting from the stand and the side lines.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
He realized now that the shouting had been going
on from the first, but it had been only a meaningless
roar in his ears. Now he mentally pictured the
tense faces on the crowded stand and along the ropes
and felt an alien sympathy for the hundred who
were shouting their throats dry in encouragement of
his pursuers. For he knew that only a tithe of that
uproar meant a desire for his success. It was those
behind whom the cries acclaimed. The runner’s
strained face twisted in a grim smile as he realized it,
and, smiling, he found new resolution to win his
race. It is generally the under dog who fights
hardest.</p>

<p>Past the enemy’s forty now, and still free! <a href="#i_frontis">The
footsteps pounded behind on the frosty turf</a> and yet
seemed scarce nearer. If only he could hold on a
few moments longer! Barely more than a half
dozen trampled white lines remained to be crossed.
If only he dared look behind! His head was falling
back now with every plunge, the arm that held the
ball seemed nerveless. Once he stumbled slightly,
enough to throw him out of his stride, and it seemed
whole minutes to him before he had settled back
into the dogged pace. His steps were shorter now.
His feet were leaden and every lift was made at a
greater effort. Once, near the twenty-five yards, he
heard his name called gaspingly, but he knew better
than to heed. It was a trick of the enemy. It was
only later that he realized the error of that reasoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>On and still on! Across the twenty-yard-line,
over the fifteen! The footsteps behind sounded
farther away, but he would take no chances. The
lime lines were an interminable distance apart. It
seemed to Monty that he spent minutes between one
and another and that he lifted his aching knees a
dozen times. He wondered why the pursuers failed
to reach him, for he was sure that he was moving
no faster than a walk! Then, abruptly, but one
white mark lay ahead, and a sudden certainty of
triumph filled him with joy. Even if he was caught
now, he could, he told himself, struggle on for that
last five yards. Already two were gone and the goal
line dragged itself to meet him. Another stride
and another and the line passed waveringly underfoot.
Instinctively he turned to the right toward the
posts, but the turning mixed his feet up and he fell
to his knees. Weakly he arose once more and went
on. He was dimly aware of the thud of meeting
bodies nearby. He covered the last twenty feet
fairly in the act of falling, so that when the nearest
goal-post swam past his misty sight he had only time
to put his arm out before he stretched his length on
the sod.</p>

<p>But oh, the delicious feel of that ground under
him! He wondered if one felt as he did before one
fainted. If only he could get air into his empty
lungs! He tried hard to take long breaths, but
could only pant, and the breath seemed to get no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
further than his throat. The inside of his head was
swirling around and around curiously and he couldn’t
see. Then he found that he had closed his eyes,
which explained the darkness, and opened them
weakly and saw a blur of russet-green. That was
the grass. Perhaps if he turned over on his
back——</p>

<p>The question was settled for him, for someone
laid hands on his shoulders and turned him face upwards.
And someone shouted “Water!” in a perfectly
thunderous voice, and Monty wondered if he
would ever be able to shout like that! The next
moment he was snatched back from semi-consciousness
by hands tugging at his left arm. They were
trying to get the ball away from him! And he had
thought them friends! He resisted with every ounce
of strength left him and opened his eyes to a glare
of blue sky that pained him and said as loud and
defiantly as he could: “<em>Down!</em>”</p>

<p>The person beside him heard the whisper and
laughed pantingly. “All right, Crail,” he said.
“Drop the ball and give me that arm.”</p>

<p>Monty looked up and saw the face of Hobo Ordway
bending over him. He sighed and released his
tense muscles. Ordway began pumping his arms
and Monty shook his head weakly. “I’m all right—now,
partner,” he murmured. “Just—a little—short
of breath.”</p>

<p>Further speech was impossible, for something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
very cold and dripping obliterated speech and sight.
Monty squirmed and said “<em>Ugh!</em>” and wrested an
arm away from Ordway. “Gosh! Want to drown
a fellow?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Lie still,” replied a callous voice. The sponge
went on sopping and Monty decided that, after the
first shock, it felt rather pleasant. He was breathing
more easily now, although his lungs still felt hot
and scraped, but when he raised his knees he had to
groan.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Davy Richards.</p>

<p>“Just my legs, thanks,” explained Monty, very
elaborately since he had an idea that his voice was
not yet in good working order. “They are awfully
tired.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix ’em!” The sponge left his face and went
sopping down on the fronts of his pants. It took a
moment or two for the water to penetrate the canvas
and the padding, but when it did it felt wonderful
against those aching legs. “How’s that?” asked the
trainer.</p>

<p>“Great, thanks! I guess I’ll get up.”</p>

<p>“No hurry. You’re not wanted.”</p>

<p>“Not wanted? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Williams is in.”</p>

<p>“Williams! In my place? What for?” Monty
sat up very suddenly and stared amazedly toward
the field. At the farther end the game was going on
without him! Monty gave a lunge that almost sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Davy on his face and struggled to his feet. “Here,”
he cried, “I’m in that!”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not, lad. You’re off. You did your
share. Come on across to the bench and get a
blanket on you.”</p>

<p>“But—but I made the touchdown, didn’t I?” demanded
Monty anxiously.</p>

<p>“Sure you did. And Winslow kicked goal. Come
on now.”</p>

<p>“But—when? Where was I? Do you mean they
kicked goal while I was lying there?”</p>

<p>“They did. Maybe you wanted them to wait for
you,” said the trainer sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Monty suffered Davy to put an arm under
his elbow and lead him across the corner of the gridiron.
“He might have let me play it out,” he added
after a moment.</p>

<p>“Sure, you’d be playin’ a fine game, wouldn’t you?
There’s only a minute or two more, lad. Let the
other fellow have his chance.”</p>

<p>As they neared the bench a smattering of applause
met him, but Monty scarcely heard it. “How far
behind was the other fellow when I crossed the goal
line?” he asked Davy.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Ordway?”</p>

<p>“No, I mean the—the Middleton fellow; the one
who chased me all the way down.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any Middleton feller,” replied
Davy. “They never had a chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” Monty sank to the bench, wide-eyed,
open-mouthed. “Do you mean to tell me that I was
running away from one of our fellows?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” answered Davy, with a chuckle. “It was
you and Ordway alone after the forty yards, and
you gained on him all the way!”</p>

<p>“Snakes!” groaned Monty.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">He heard the true story of that run on the way
back to Grafton. What surprised him was
that no one seemed to appreciate the humor
of it as he did. To have nearly killed himself in
order to beat one of his own team to the goal line
struck Monty as being the height of humor—or
irony; he wasn’t certain which! The Middleton pursuit
had started late and had practically given up the
race after Monty had crossed the fifty-yard-line. Bellows
and Ordway had put two men out and Ordway
had finally slowed down and trailed Monty to the
line, pursued some twenty yards behind by the Middleton
quarterback. The latter had tried to get
Monty after he had crossed, to prevent him from
centering the ball, and Ordway had dived into him.
But no one appeared to think it in the least strange
that Monty had driven himself at top-speed and his
efforts to make them see the humor of it brought
only smiles.</p>

<p>“A fellow doesn’t have a chance to see what’s coming,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
said Will Brunswick seriously. “All he can do
is put his head down and beat it! I remember a
couple of years ago when I was playing on my class
team I got the ball near the forty yards and was
nearly to the end of the field before I looked around
and found I was being chased by the umpire! There
was no one else around!”</p>

<p>“You certainly cut out a pace for yourself,” said
Pete Gowen.</p>

<p>“I certainly must have,” agreed Monty, ruefully
stretching the aching muscles of his legs. “What
gets me is my nearly running my feet off with no
one after me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they were after you all right at first,” said
Pete. “How the dickens you slipped through that
bunch I don’t see. I thought you were gone half a
dozen times. Where did you learn to twist and
dodge like that, Crail?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that I did twist,” laughed Monty.
“To tell the truth, I don’t remember much about
what happened from the time I got the ball until I
was halfway to the goal! I guess it was pure luck,
Gowen.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the sort of luck that looks a heap like
science then. If we didn’t have a raft of good
backs I’d look for Bonner to try you at half after
today’s performance. Ever played behind?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve never played anywhere but at guard
and if it takes the sort of stunt I pulled off today I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
don’t think I want to! I guess running isn’t my
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly footed it that time, Crail!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I was a dead dog when I got there.”</p>

<p>Gowen shrugged. “You most always are. When
you run eighty yards at that pace you don’t have
much breath left to cheer with. You’ll be feeling
fine tomorrow. Better go over to the gym in the
morning, though, and get Davy to give you a good
rubbing.”</p>

<p>That run didn’t make a hero of Monty, probably
because the score wasn’t needed and little depended
on its success. But it had been sufficiently thrilling
for awhile to partly atone for that, and it did send
Monty’s stock up considerably. From a practically
unknown substitute he emerged a player of promise,
one of whom something equally brilliant might be
expected again. Members of the team nodded or
spoke more familiarly to him when he met them and
others who had before never noticed him were now
careful to claim recognition. But the feat didn’t
alter his standing on the squad so far as he could
see, and it certainly didn’t cause his removal to the
training table. After all, as he told himself, luck
had played a big part in the performance. Luck
had caused the ball to bound toward him instead of
in another direction and luck had guided him through
the ranks of the enemy. All he had done was run
like the dickens! And one doesn’t get promotion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
for doing merely what is natural and instructive.</p>

<p>Leon, however, and Jimmy and Dud as well, insisted
that he was a hero. Leon was quite incensed
because Coach Bonner didn’t oust Gowen and put
Monty in his place. Monty had been, he warmly
maintained, the star of the game. Monty grinned.
“A little piece of luck, Leon,” he said. “I might
not do it again if I played football twenty years.
I’m not half the player that Pete Gowen is, and I
don’t believe I ever shall be.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s comment was—well, more Jimmyish!
“It’s only Bonner’s pig-headedness that keeps him
from yanking you off the bench,” he declared.
“Bonner hates to acknowledge that he’s made a mistake.
All coaches do. You might as well hand in
your resignation tomorrow, Monty. No matter
what stupendous stunts you pull off now, you won’t
get your deserts. They just won’t see them. I
know, for I tried football myself once. I did things
that no other football player ever even attempted,
old dear, and did I get a kind word and an invitation
to dinner with the coach? I did not. I got fired!
There’s gratitude and appreciation for you! I
guess—” Jimmy half closed his eyes and shook
his head sadly—“I guess I’d have been captain
by now.”</p>

<p>The effect on Alvin Standart of Monty’s touchdown
in the Middleton game was peculiar. Alvin
appeared to take it as a personal insult. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
quite depressed over it all Sunday, and never lost a
chance to comment on it disagreeably. “I suppose
you think you’re a regular hero now,” he sneered.
“Trotted all the way down the field with the ball,
didn’t you? I guess if the ball hadn’t jumped into
your arms and someone hadn’t given you a shove
you’d be standing around there yet. You’re waiting
for Bert Winslow to step out and give you the
captaincy, I dare say. When are they going to take
you to training table? Have you and Bonner
planned next week’s game yet?”</p>

<p>Most of Alvin’s wit, though, went unheeded.
Monty had acquired an ability to let his roommate
talk on and on without hearing him, a fortunate
acquirement since otherwise Monty would have been
tired or angry half the time. Life with Alvin Standart
was not a bed of roses nowadays and almost
anyone but Monty would have either dropped Alvin
out a window or run away in self-defence. Sometimes
Monty was tempted to do one or the other of
those things, but he always managed to summon his
sense of humor to his aid. After all, he reasoned,
Alvin’s mouthings and meannesses were too silly to
be taken seriously. One might much better laugh at
them. But that Sunday afternoon, when Alvin had
begun his nagging for the twentieth time since the
game, Monty’s patience and sense of humor gave
out. He was trying to compose one of his monthly
letters to Mr. Holman, his guardian, and Alvin’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
rasping voice was too much for him. So at last he
arose and, not without trouble, put the objectionable
roommate outside and locked the door on him.
Alvin kicked and hammered and shouted until the
others assembled en masse and read the riot act
to him. After that he disappeared until supper
time and Monty, making the most of the unaccustomed
tranquillity, wrote a full seven pages to his
guardian.</p>

<p>Of course he told about yesterday’s game and his
part in it. He assured Mr. Holman several times
that his contribution to the final total of twenty-two
points was of no importance and had been entirely
due to a piece of luck, but he dwelt on the event to
the extent of two pages. Then he reported a slight
betterment in class standing and subsequently gave a
quite dispassionate account of the affair of the missing
keys, and ended with:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So maybe they’ll get me some fine day and I’ll have to
pull my freight. If I do I guess I’ll go home until January.
I might try that school I started for, only they don’t
think much of it here, you see. I guess some place out our
way would do just as well. I’ll be kind of sorry if they do
give me the gate because I like this outfit mighty well.
Maybe you had better send me some money in case I leave
hurriedly. I’m about down to the core of that roll I fetched
away with me. There might be a fine to pay, too, because
if Standart shoots off his mouth to the faculty I’m sure going
to treat him brutal.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>The next afternoon Monty found a surprise
awaiting him at the field. After tackling practice,
at which Monty had developed more than a fair
degree of proficiency, he was on his way to join the
third squad for signal work when Coach Bonner
summoned him back.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give you a try at fullback, Crail,”
said the coach. “You’ve never played behind the
line, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you could. Anyway, you have a
try at it. If you get the hang of playing full you’re
likely to be useful the rest of the season. Have you
any idea at all of a fullback’s duties?”</p>

<p>Monty shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, sir. I know he carries the ball
and kicks——”</p>

<p>“Never mind the kicking. Blake or Winslow will
do that. You’d better put your blanket on and follow
the play this afternoon. Watch Caner, and try
to get an idea of what’s wanted. You showed some
pretty good stuff Saturday, Crail, and it seems to me
that if you buckled down, and really tried you could
make a fairly good running back. Manson’s knee
is going to trouble him for a couple of weeks, I
guess, and you may have a chance to play against
Hollywood. I’m not promising it, but there’s a fair
chance, Crail. Now, get your blanket and keep your
eyes open. Watch Caner’s position in the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
plays, and remember what you learn. What are you
doing tonight?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, sir.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d drop around and see me at about
eight. You know where I live? All right.”</p>

<p>So Monty, draped in a gray blanket, ambled
around the field in the rear of the first squad during
signal practice, and later, when the second came trotting
over to try conclusions, hung around the flanks
of the first team as it went up and down the field.
Caner was not the fullback that Manson was, but
he had experience, and was a good model for a tyro
to copy. Now and then Mr. Bonner came up to
Monty, and drew his attention to some feature of
the play, but for the most he was left to master
things as best he could. When practice was over—the
second gave a good account of itself that day,
and only allowed the first one touchdown—Monty
followed to the field house in dejection. If, he told
himself, he had learned anything as to the duties of
a fullback he didn’t know what it was!</p>

<p>Consequently, he made his way in to the village
that evening feeling somewhat dubious. If Mr.
Bonner should ask him what he knew now about
playing fullback that he hadn’t known before practice
he would have to make the depressing confession
that he knew nothing. Monty almost wished
that the coach had not selected him for this new
rôle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>But the interview wasn’t unpleasant, after all.
Mr. Bonner made him comfortable in a deep armchair,
and for the first twenty minutes kept the conversation
far from football. Somewhat to his surprise,
Monty found himself telling about a summer
camping trip to the Big Horns, with the football
coach listening with real interest. When he had
finished, Mr. Bonner said: “I’d like mighty well to
do that very thing some time, Crail, but I don’t suppose
I ever shall. You must tell me some more
about your part of the country some day. Well,
now let’s see. Think you learned anything today?”</p>

<p>Monty frowned ruefully. “I don’t think I did,
sir,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you did,” replied the coach cheerfully.
“Let’s find out. Suppose your team’s on the
defensive. Where would you stand?”</p>

<p>“Behind center,” said Monty doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, how far behind?”</p>

<p>“Caner stood about six yards usually, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“So he could see what was coming, and stop it.”</p>

<p>“Right. That’s where he has an advantage over
the other backs, Crail. He must be guided by the
center, though. If his center plays up in the line
he will be further in himself. In other words, the
fullback measures his distance from his center, and
not from his line. You see you did learn something
after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“Mighty little,” grumbled Monty.</p>

<p>“You probably learned more, and don’t know it,”
laughed the coach. “I’m going to tell you a few
fundamental things about the position, Crail, which
is about all anyone can tell. The rest you’ll have
to learn for yourself. After all, football isn’t different
from any other game. It consists of applying
common sense to physical ability. And a fullback
is just a halfback under another name. Time
was when there was more difference between a half
and a full. Then the fullback was never used for
plays outside of tackle. His business was to have
a lot of weight and strength, and slam himself at
the center of the line. Now he has to do a little
of everything, buck the center, slide off the tackles,
or run the ends. If he can kick besides, so much
the better. If he can get forward passes off, still
better. But in the final analysis, he’s a third halfback.</p>

<p>“Playing back where he can look over the lines
and watch the opposing backfield, however, he’s in
a position to diagnose the enemy’s plays quicker than
any other man on his side. Of course, guessing
what the other fellow is going to do is largely a
matter of practice and experience, but it’s something
that every fullback ought to learn to do. Watch
the little signs, Crail. Watch the faces of the backs
and the center. Many a time you’ll get a hunch
from a look. Sometimes, too, a nervous or too-eager<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
back will give the play away by an unconscious
shifting of his body in the direction of the
point of attack. You may get fooled on that point,
though, for some backs will deliberately bluff; it’s
an old trick. You must be on your toes every second,
ready to follow the other fellow’s shift. Your
duty is to find out where the play is coming, and be
ready to meet it. You’ll get fooled at first, I guess,
for some shifts are used simply to pull you and the
other backs away from the play. Only experience
can teach you when a shift is just a fake.”</p>

<p>“The next thing is to watch the ball, Crail, from
the instant it goes into play. Keep it in sight until
you know just where it is going, or until you can’t
see it. Then make up your mind where you think
it is, find the direction of the runner who has it, and
get into position to meet him. Aim for the man
with the ball, Crail. Never mind the interference.
It’s the runner you want.”</p>

<p>“On punts by the other side your place is twelve
or fifteen yards back. It’s up to you to put out anyone
coming through between tackles, and after that
to get into the interference for the runner back.
Kicking you won’t have. Not this year, anyhow,
although if you make good it will be worth your
while to learn that end of the game. At present
you will move up into Winslow’s place when he
drops back to punt.”</p>

<p>“When you carry the ball, you will, as I told you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
have to sample every opening in the line, and run
the ends. You must learn to pick your holes quickly,
ward off tackles, and get up your speed before you
reach the line. There’s a lot in knowing how to
use your speed, Crail, but I can’t instruct you. It’s
another thing you just have to learn for yourself.
Of course, you know you can’t carry the ball in one
arm on plunges between tackles. Both hands on
the ends then, and the ball well up against the body.
Learn to keep your head up in running, Crail. Going
it blind is poor policy. Besides, if you keep
your head up and your chest out, and carry your
knees high you get a machine-like motion, with every
part of you working together. Now, I don’t expect
you to remember all this stuff tomorrow, but I do
expect you to remember some of it. I’m going to
give you a chance tomorrow to show how much
you do remember. To recapitulate, Crail: on defence,
watch the other side for the play, keep your
eyes on the ball, go for the runner every time. On
offense, get started quick, hit the line hard, and don’t
stop until you’re sure you can’t make another inch.
Better think over what I’ve said on your way home,
and then forget it until tomorrow. Good-night.
Some day I want to hear more about that western
country of yours. We’ll get together, and have another
pow-wow if you like.”</p>

<p>Monty dutifully went over what he had been told,
on his way back to Morris, and tried hard to picture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
himself playing against Hollywood School next
Saturday in Manson’s place. But his imagination
wasn’t equal to the task. And, besides that, he was,
although he wouldn’t have acknowledged it to anyone,
distinctly scared!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<small>BACK OF THE LINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next afternoon he again followed Caner
about during signal work, while Nick Blake
barked his demands, and the squad scurried
this way and that in response. Then he went to
the bench and watched the second team hold the
first to no score during two ten-minute periods. He
wondered whether Mr. Bonner had forgotten him,
and was sometimes inclined to hope he had. But
he hadn’t, for when the third period began, after
a five-minute rest, with half a dozen second-string
men in the line-up, Monty found himself standing
down near the east goal in company with Weston,
who had taken Blake’s place, and Brunswick and
Ordway, feeling a bit conspicuous and decidedly
nervous. He sincerely hoped the kick-off would not
put the ball into his territory, for he was certain
he wouldn’t be able to catch it. Fortunately, perhaps,
it didn’t. It was Brunswick who fell heir to
the slowly-descending, revolving pigskin, and Brunswick,
who, snuggling in behind the interference,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
plunged along for ten yards or so under cover, and
then, deprived of assistance, swerved to the left, and
gained another five at the cost of a long run across
the field. Monty had been spilled early in the proceedings,
and now he picked himself up, and trotted
across to the line-up, trying hard to recall some of
the advice so generously bestowed last evening.</p>

<p>But he forgot about advice in a twinkling, for he
was doing his best to clear out a hole inside left
tackle for Ordway, and doing it, too. His weight
and strength told when he hurled himself between
the panting linesmen, and Hobo followed through
for a fine four yards. Someone met Monty’s charge
with a hard shoulder, and he plowed up the turf.
But he didn’t mind that, for the ball was four yards
nearer the west goal, and the fighting spirit was
aroused. Twice more Ordway was given the ball,
and twice more he won through, and it was first
down. Then came an unsuccessful plunge by Brunswick
at the center, and then the signal that made
Monty’s heart pound a little harder. It was a delayed
pass to fullback that Weston called for, and
to save his life Monty couldn’t resist the impulse
that made him shift his body a little to the right.
Instantly, Coach Bonner’s voice exploded.</p>

<p>“Hold up!” He darted in and faced Monty
scowlingly, a very different Mr. Bonner from the
one who had listened smilingly to his camping yarns.
“You gave that play away, Crail!” he snarled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
“Don’t shift toward the point of attack, don’t look
toward it! A child could have guessed that play!
Change signals, Quarter! All right! Let’s show
something now, First!”</p>

<p>“All right! Now get this, fellows!” cried Weston,
after an insulting glare at Monty. It was
Brunswick again, around the end, with Monty leading
the way. But the second team end was waiting,
and there was no gain. Again came the signal
with Monty’s number, but this time it was a straight
plunge into the center. He tried not to even wink.
Then he was plunging ahead, his eyes on the ball
in Weston’s hands. He got it, clasped it to him
and bored into the opening. The halfs had crossed
in front of him, and were charging past right tackle,
and the diversion was fooling the opponent’s secondary
defense. Monty banged through, was
stopped momentarily, squirmed another yard, and
went down with a quarter of a ton of the enemy
on him. He had won the better part of three yards,
and, as someone literally lifted him to his feet, he
was inclined to be a trifle self-satisfied. But the self-satisfaction
vanished when Coach Bonner called:
“You missed a foot then, Crail, by holding the ball
too low. When you’re stopped swing the ball up to
your chest. It’s just as safe there. Every inch
counts, Crail. Remember that next time.”</p>

<p>It was second down and seven to go, and Brunswick
went back to punt. Monty slipped into his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
place at left half. “Over further,” directed Weston.
“Watch that second team tackle, Crail.” Then
came the signals, the ball sped past Monty, the lines
heaved, and a big second team man charged down
on him. In that instant Monty thought, “Why
doesn’t he hurry? Isn’t he ever going to kick?”
Then the second team man was on him, and Monty
had his hands full. How it happened he couldn’t
have told, but somehow that opponent swung him
to the left, and went inside him, and someone collided
with him as he staggered, and he went down,
sprawling. And when he could look around the
teams, save for three or four players, who, like he,
had capsized, were jumbled furiously in quest of a
trickling ball.</p>

<p>“That was up to you, Crail!” called Mr. Bonner.
“You let that man inside you. Keep them out if
you can’t stop them! You’ll have to do better than
that.”</p>

<p>The big second team fellow who had outmanœuvered
him grinned at Monty as the latter came up.
There was nothing unkind in the grin, however, nor
in the comment that accompanied it. “You’ll learn,
Crail,” said the second team tackle.</p>

<p>Monty set his lips firmly, and trotted subduedly
back to position. Tray had captured the ball for
the first, and it was first down back near the twenty-five-yard
line. Brunswick got a couple of yards off
left tackle, and Ordway added two more around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
right end. Then Brunswick again went back. This
time the big tackle was stopped in the line, and the
kick was not blocked. Second worked the ends for
small gains, and sent a forward pass obliquely across
the field. It was not caught, however. Then she
punted, and Weston came back with the ball to the
first’s twenty-seven. Again Monty was called on,
and again he struck the line for three yards. Ordway
got clean away past left tackle for twelve.
Monty slid off the same tackle for four, and was so
thoroughly jarred when he was downed that he had
to have time called for him. Brunswick made it first
down a moment later, with Monty interfering, and
the ball was past the middle of the field. Offside
put the first back, however, and Ordway’s attempt
to knife through was stopped. Brunswick took the
ball on a wide end run for no gain. Brunswick
went back, but the pigskin was thrown to Ordway,
and that fleet-footed youth made eight around the
left of the line. Monty got the signals mixed that
time and started the wrong way, and Weston was
on him savagely.</p>

<p>“What was wrong with you, you idiot?” he demanded.
“If you don’t get the signal, sing out.”</p>

<p>Brunswick faked a kick and threw forward to
Tray, and the latter was forced over the side line.
But the tape gave the first team its distance. Weston
got two straight ahead through center, and
Monty tried the right end and banged squarely into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the arms of an opposing tackle for a yard loss.
Brunswick punted to the second’s five yards, and
Tray threw the catcher on the ten. Second was
put back half the distance to goal for holding on
the next play, and then punted to her thirty-two.
Monty had the ineffable pleasure of diving into the
big second team tackle as he romped down the field,
and sending him sprawling over the ground. The
tackle only grinned as he picked himself up. Monty
experienced a fine glow of satisfaction. The quarter
ended with the ball on the second’s twenty-eight
in possession of the first team.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Crail,” said Mr. Bonner. “Trot in
and don’t hang around. Fenton! Fullback, here!”</p>

<p>Monty trotted obediently to the field house, although
he would much rather have walked, and subsided,
panting on a bench. It had been for him a
strenuous quarter of an hour. Playing in the line,
and back of it were two vastly different things, he
decided. As he got out of his togs he went over
his performance in memory, and wondered just how
bad he had been. If criticism was a criterion, he
had played perfectly rotten, he thought, but he knew
enough of football practice by now to realize that
even the best players on a team are sometimes
“bawled out” by the coaches. On the whole, he
guessed, he had done no worse than might have been
expected of an inexperienced fullback, and he took
heart and dragged himself wearily to the shower,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
one hand rubbing a set of very lame ribs where the
too intimate knee of a tackler had settled.</p>

<p>The rest of the players trooped in before he had
completed a very leisurely dressing. To his surprise,
Gus Weston, who had twice looked as if he
could have choked him with much pleasure, came
across and sat down beside him. “You did pretty
well, Crail,” he said, as he began to unloose his
shoes. “It’s always hard for a fellow who has
played in the line to come back of it. He’s got to
be a heap more active. You’ll get the hang of it
in a few days, though.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about getting that signal wrong,” said
Monty humbly.</p>

<p>“What signal was that? Oh, yes, I’d forgotten.
Oh, we all do that. Say, you mustn’t mind what I
do when a play goes wrong, Crail. I’m likely to
call you all sorts of things. It’s part of the day’s
work. A fellow gets sort of nutty when he’s running
the team.” Weston kicked his shoes off, picked
them up with a groan, and nodded encouragingly.
“Speed up a little, Crail, and put more pep into it
and you’ll come along fine.”</p>

<p>Monty looked gratefully after Weston as the latter
went back to his locker. He had minded what
Weston had said—and looked—but after this he
wouldn’t. He put his things away, slammed the
locker door and started out. On the steps he encountered
Coach Bonner and Burgess, the manager.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
They were busy with their heads over the afternoon’s
report, but the coach glanced up, smiled and
nodded.</p>

<p>“Not bad, Crail,” he said. “A little more punch
tomorrow, though.”</p>

<p>Monty went across to the tennis courts to find
Leon, but that youth had finished his game and departed.
On the way back to Morris, Monty puzzled
over the recent criticisms. Weston had advised him
to speed up and get more pep into his playing, and
Coach Bonner had spoken of more punch. Pep and
punch were undoubtedly synonymous, and since both
critics had observed a lack of those qualities he had
probably been deficient in them. But he couldn’t see
how it was possible to play any harder than he had
played, nor any faster. It seemed to him that, while
he had undoubtedly blundered, he had been a marvel
of speed and grim determination. If they expected
him to play faster or hit the line harder tomorrow
they were, he feared, doomed to disappointment.
He shook his head over the problem as he skirted
the house. “I guess,” he muttered, “I’m not cut out
for a fullback!”</p>

<p>Collins, the colored factotum, who tended the furnaces
in Morris and Fuller, emerged from the cellar
as Monty passed the bulkhead. Collins was lazy
and undependable, and forever in hot water around
the place, but everyone liked him, Monty especially.
Collins touched his hat and scraped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“I give you good evening, Mr. Crail. A tolerably
sharp evening, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Collins,” responded Monty, pausing.
“Yes, it is a bit chilly. How’s the old scrap pile
down there?”</p>

<p>It was one of Collins’ pleasant fictions that the
heating plants in the two dormitories were so old
and decrepit that they no longer could perform what
was expected of them, a fiction which proved very
convenient when he sought an excuse for not providing
enough heat.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, she’s just holding together. I got her
going pretty good, and I reckon she’ll carry along
till morning if the fire don’t fall down through the
grate or something. You been playing football,
Mr. Crail?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to, Collins, but they tell me I’m
not fast enough for them.”</p>

<p>“Land sakes, sir, don’t you pay no attention to
what they tells you. Why, you’re one of the best
players they’ve got this year. Yes, sir, I hear that
everywhere I go.”</p>

<p>“Collins, you’re a very polite liar, aren’t you?”
laughed Monty.</p>

<p>“Me, sir?” Collins looked horribly hurt.
“That’s no lie, Mr. Crail, sir. Everybody’s talking
about your playing, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right. Did you—er—want to see me about
any little matter, Collins?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did, and that’s a fact,” beamed Collins.
“You’ve been mighty accommodating to me,
sir, and I’m not forgetting it.” He glanced warily
toward the windows and lowered his voice. “If you
could make me the loan of two-bits till pay-day, Mr.
Crail, I’d be extremely obliged to you, sir, I would so.”</p>

<p>“What is it this time?” asked Monty gravely.
“No more of the children sick, I hope?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; it ain’t that. It’s——”</p>

<p>“The one that had the whooping-cough is well
again, is she? And the one that had appendicitis?
And the one that had bubonic plague?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t any of them have that last thing, Mr.
Crail. I reckon that’s all they ain’t had, too.” Collins
chuckled. “No, sir; it ain’t the children, sir.
It’s my lodge dues, Mr. Crail. I just got to pay
them tonight or I loses my standing. They’s awfully
strict about dues, Mr. Crail.”</p>

<p>“I see. All right. Here you are. That makes—how
much, Collins?”</p>

<p>“Four dollars and a quarter, sir. Yes, sir, exactly
four and a quarter. Thank you kindly, Mr. Crail.
Just you speak to me about it when pay-day comes,
case I forgets it.”</p>

<p>“Sure, but when is pay-day, Collins? Fourth of
July?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, pay-day’s the first of every month.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Well, you sort of forgot me last time,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid I did,” said Collins regretfully. “I’m
afraid I did, sir, and that’s a fact. Money don’t
last no time at all these days, sir, and I reckon it
was all gone before I remembered about you, sir.
But next time——”</p>

<p>“Next time it is, Collins,” said Monty cheerfully.
“Don’t spend it all in one place now. Scatter it,
scatter it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; thank you, sir,” chuckled Collins. “I’ll
scatter it like it was bird seed, Mr. Crail!”</p>

<p>Monty went upstairs smiling. It was always
worth a quarter to hear Collins’ excuses for not repaying
the loans made him, and Monty was not the
only one who parted with some such sum almost
weekly, although it is probable that he was more
complaisant than the others. There was a note
from Leon on the table, and Monty took it to the
window and read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Come over to Jimmy’s after supper. There’s a meeting
of the Clan. The password is “What’s in a name?” Don’t
fail, on peril of your life!</p>
</div>

<p>Monty smiled as he crumpled up the note, and
tossed it into the wastebasket. The Clan was a
purely fictitious organization of Jimmy’s devising
which had for its chief object the annihilation of the
faculty. Jimmy had appointed himself Grand
Visor, Leon was Custodian of the Crown, Dud was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Leader of the Band, and Monty held the exalted
office of Little-Button-on-Top. He was still smiling
when Alvin Standart entered, and Alvin seized the
opportunity to nag.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hero!” he greeted. “Make any more
wonderful touchdowns today? I hear they have put
you at fullback so you won’t get hurt by the rough
linesmen.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it, Standart. What’s the book?”</p>

<p>“New catalogue,” replied Alvin, laying the
pamphlet in his hand very carefully on his own chiffonier.
“Just out.”</p>

<p>“Catalogue of what?” asked Monty.</p>

<p>“School catalogue, you idiot.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Let’s have a look.”</p>

<p>“Go and get one of your own. They have them
at the office. I want to send this one home, and
don’t want it mussed up.”</p>

<p>“Snakes, but you’re an obliging <em>hombre</em>! Take
your old catalogue, and fall out the window with it,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you get one of your own, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, if I mention your name. Standart,
every day I associate with you I discover some new
and lovable quality.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the dickens!” muttered Alvin.</p>

<p>Instead, Monty went in to see Joe Mullins. He
ate an exceptionally hearty supper as a result of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
exertions on the gridiron, and after chatting for
awhile on the front steps, made his way through the
early darkness across the campus to Lothrop. He
was feeling in particularly good spirits this evening,
and very kindly toward the whole world, and as he
climbed the slate stairway to Number 14 he wondered
smilingly what new absurdity Jimmy had
thought up for the Clan to accomplish. Had he
known what awaited him he would have smiled less
genially.</p>

<small>WHAT’S IN A NAME?</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were all there when he entered, Jimmy,
Dud and Leon. Jimmy was sitting huddled
up on the window seat with his banjo across
his knees, Leon was stretched over as much of the
seat as was left, and Dud was sprawled in a Morris
chair. The light was turned low, and it was evident
that Jimmy had been singing. Jimmy’s singing
was always a treat. He flatted every third or fourth
note, and knew it, and was not discouraged. And
he especially fancied pathetic ballads. Of the two
accomplishments, his banjo playing was far the
better, but it was his singing that always won
the applause. He stopped strumming softly as
Monty closed the door behind him, and said
sternly:</p>

<p>“Halt, thou, and give the password!”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” said Monty, shying his cap at Dud,
and sinking into the second easy chair.</p>

<p>Jimmy grumbled. “What’s the use of having a
password,” he asked to a low accompaniment on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
instrument, “if nobody uses it? Want me to sing,
Monty?”</p>

<p>“Is it necessary?”</p>

<p>“Give him the last one, Jimmy,” begged Leon.
“You’ll love this, Monty. It’s no end sad, and
Jimmy sings it with so much feeling.”</p>

<p>“Executes it, you mean,” corrected Dud.</p>

<p>“I composed it myself,” said Jimmy, modestly.
“This morning in math. It’s called ‘I Didn’t Choose
My Name.’ There’s only one verse so far, but I
shall write more.”</p>

<p>“If you live,” suggested Monty.</p>

<p>“Shut up and let him sing it,” said Leon. “It’s
great, Monty.”</p>

<p>So Jimmy strummed an introduction, and then,
tilting his head back, sang:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One day when I was walking</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Across the old school yard</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I chanced upon a fellow</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And he was crying hard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Said I, ‘What is your trouble?’</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">I thought his heart would break.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">His tearful eyes he raised to mine</div>

    <div class="verse indent3">But, oh, I’m not to blame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Although I’ve done some dirty deeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">I didn’t choose my name!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Chorus, now! Get into it, fellows!”</p>

<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The ditty ended in a long-drawn wail of excruciating
dissonance, and three pairs of eyes regarded
Monty inquiringly.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” demanded Dud. “Didn’t that get
you, Monty?”</p>

<p>“It sure did! It made me want to cry.”</p>

<p>“It would,” said Jimmy proudly. “Some pathetic,
that is.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, it reminded me of home,” agreed
Monty sentimentally. “Many is the time I’ve heard
them singing just like that.”</p>

<p>“Heard who?” inquired Leon, with suspicion.</p>

<p>“The coyotes,” answered Monty, wiping away an
imaginary tear.</p>

<p>There was a silence of long duration. Finally:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
“I’m not sure that the gentleman is complimentary,”
murmured Jimmy, wafting a few depressed chords
from the banjo. “His remark savors of—of——”</p>

<p>“It’s an insult,” said Dud, decisively. “He ought
to be made to hear another verse.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no other verse,” said Jimmy, regretfully.
“Not yet. Let me see.” He strummed
thoughtfully.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our tears together mingled</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Beneath the maples there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Said I then in choking voice:</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">‘What is the name you bear?’</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">He shook his head—tum, tumpty, tum——”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Jimmy faltered! “He shook his head— He
shook his head——”</p>

<p>“Maybe he had a chill,” suggested Leon.</p>

<p>“He shook— Well, I’ll have to let it go for
now. I have to be in the mood. That’s the way
with all of us great song writers. But you do like
it, don’t you, Monty dear?”</p>

<p>“I’m crazy about it. Or I would be if I heard
it again.” Despite a certain ambiguity, Jimmy accepted
the praise at its face value and bowed. “It’s
funny how the idea of that song came to me,” he
remarked, dreamily. “I was listening to Wilcox explaining
in that simple, direct way of his how he
had arrived at a most extraordinary result in trig.,
and watching dear Mr. Nellis’s expression change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
from one of bewilderment to a sort of rapt incredulity——”</p>

<p>“They say he reads Henry James in the original,”
whispered Dud admiringly.</p>

<p>“—When the great idea flashed upon me. ‘How
awful,’ I thought, ‘to go through life with an impossible
name like—like—well, like some of the impossible
names folks do go through life with.’” Leon
had a violent fit of coughing. Monty’s gaze narrowed.
“One would, of course, do one’s best to
cloak the—the disgrace, but eventually the horrific
truth would out. What a tragedy! Imagine a man
leading a blameless life for years and years, liked
and respected by his neighbors, beloved by his family,
and then having his name suddenly become
known! Could anything be more horribly painful,
more—er—dramatic? ‘There,’ said I, ‘is subject
for a pathetic ballad. I will write it!’ No sooner
exclaimed than executed. With my faithful fountain-pen,
which happened to be working this morning
for some unknown reason, I composed the words
on a fly-leaf of my trigonometry. Dear Mr. Nellis
interrupted me once with a request for information,
but I waved him aside. The music was composed
at the piano later. It is very nice music. I forget
who wrote it first.”</p>

<p>“I like it because it’s so familiar,” murmured
Leon. “You don’t have to learn it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Monty, “that you fellows know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
what your trouble is, but I don’t. If you think I’m
going to sit around here and listen to your yawping
all the evening——”</p>

<p>“Talking about names,” interrupted Dud hurriedly,
“I knew a fellow once who was called Rolla.”</p>

<p>“Did he come?” asked Jimmy interestedly. “I
shouldn’t have.”</p>

<p>“Rolla isn’t bad,” said Leon. “A fellow I know
is named Alonzo.”</p>

<p>“Horace always gets me,” said Jimmy, “but the
name that takes the cake is Roscoe. I knew one
once. His full name was Roscoe Cassius Updike.”</p>

<p>“How about Chauncey?” asked Leon.</p>

<p>“I know a worse one,” said Dud triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Spring it, dearie.”</p>

<p>“Aloysius.”</p>

<p>“Come again?”</p>

<p>“Aloysius.”</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded thoughtfully. “Yes, I guess you
win,” he said, at last. “I presume it is German, eh?
Suggests German frightfulness. And still, there’s
Ezra. Now, some of the Biblical names are wonders.
There was a chap here last year named Absalom.
Honest to goodness, fellows. Absalom was
the name his fond parents had presented him with
in a defenceless moment! Say, parents are to blame
for lots, aren’t they? But we haven’t heard from
Monty. What’s the most—er—the most extraordinary
name you ever met with, Monty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“James,” replied Monty briefly.</p>

<p>“Really? Well, I suppose I’m used to it. But it
isn’t uncommon, like—like— What was that name
out of the Bible I heard once?” Jimmy frowned intensely.
Monty shifted his feet uneasily, and directed
nervous and somewhat suspicious glances at
his three companions. But only looks of the utmost
innocence met his regard.</p>

<p>“Melchisedec?” suggested Dud.</p>

<p>“No, that wasn’t it. That’s good, though.”
Jimmy nodded approvingly. “It was something
like—like—” He cast a vacant stare about the
room. “Seems to me it began with A: Ab—Ab——”</p>

<p>Monty fixed a scowling gaze on his shoes.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” exclaimed Jimmy in triumph. “Ab—Ab—
Abner!”</p>

<p>Monty hoped the others didn’t hear the sigh of
relief that burst from him. He cleared his throat,
and remarked carelessly: “That isn’t a bad name.
Lots of folks are called Abner.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” asked Jimmy, plainly disappointed.
“Then maybe that isn’t it. Let me see, now. Ab—Ab——”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget your old names,” said Monty desperately.
“Aren’t we going to do anything tonight?
Let’s get out and go somewhere. It’s a peach of an
evening. Just cold enough to be fine. I was talking
to Collins before supper. You know, the colored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
man who looks after the furnaces. Collins had a
new scheme this time. I’ve lent him——”</p>

<p>“What’s his first name?” asked Dud eagerly.
“Colored folks have dandy names sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think it’s Dudley, though.
Well, this time——”</p>

<p>“Say, Monty, what’s your first name?” asked
Jimmy. “You said the A didn’t stand for anything,
but you were just fooling, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t,” responded Monty. “It’s just A.
I—I had a grandfather who was called that. You
see, he had a name when he started out, but he lived
to be very old, and his memory failed him and he
couldn’t remember what his name was, and so they
just called me A after him.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Dud. “A for After.”</p>

<p>“But you could have found out what his name
was by making inquiries, couldn’t you?” asked Jimmy
solicitously. “I suppose there was a record of
his birth, wasn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he was born on the other side somewhere.
No one knew where grandfather came
from. Funny, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Very interesting,” agreed Jimmy. “He was
your father’s father?”</p>

<p>“Yes—no, my mother’s. She was French: came
from—from France.”</p>

<p>“That <em>is</em> strange,” murmured Dud. “French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
folks are like that, though. They get themselves
born in the queerest places!”</p>

<p>Monty glared. “What’s queer about a Frenchwoman
being born in France?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Pay no attention to him,” said Jimmy soothingly.
“Most natural thing in the world, if you ask me. I
suppose your grandfather’s name was Henri.
That’s a popular name with them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was: Henri Montfort.”</p>

<p>“He spelled Henri with an A?” asked Jimmy,
sweetly.</p>

<p>“What? No! Henri was his second name. His
first name was A, like I told you. A Henri Montfort.”</p>

<p>“I see. Quite simple, Monty. Well, fellows, say
we have one more little song before we go.” Jimmy
picked up his banjo again, re-crossed his legs,
bringing a grunt of remonstrance from Leon, and
struck a chord. “What’ll it be now?”</p>

<p>“‘I Didn’t Choose My Name,’” replied Dud and
Leon in unison.</p>

<p>“All right, but I wish I could think up that second
verse, fellows. Maybe it will come to me when
I get there. I’ll sing the verse, and you fellows come
in on the refrain. Let her go!”</p>

<p>So Jimmy wailed the pathetic ballad again, and
Dud and Leon howled the chorus with relish. Then,
however, instead of stopping, Jimmy began a second
verse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>As the final wail died away into silence, Monty
jumped from his chair, seized his cap and faced his
tormentors, his cheeks very, very red. “You—you
think you’re funny, don’t you?” he stammered.
“Well, you aren’t! You’re a lot of—of—of——”
But words failed him, and he strode to the door.
There, however, eloquence returned. He encompassed
the trio in a look of withering contempt.
“You make me sick!” he said.</p>

<p>The door crashed behind him, and he hurried
down the stairs, his cheeks still burning, and plunged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
off into the lamplit gloom. “Idiots!” he muttered
savagely. “Fresh kids!”</p>

<p>As he vaulted the fence into School Street, however,
anger gave place to curiosity. “Wonder,” he
muttered, “how they found it out. I’ll bet that
sneaking secretary fellow told someone. He’s the
only one that knew. I wouldn’t have told him only
he said I had to. He——”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly on the steps of Morris
House.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” he said to himself. “I’ll just bet
anything that’s it! Huh!”</p>

<p>He took the stairs two steps at a time, and swung
open the door of his room. Alvin Standart was
wreathed over an armchair by the table, reading.
As he looked up at Monty he smirked.</p>

<p>“Hello, Abijah!” he said.</p>

<p>Monty strode past him to his chiffonier in silence.
Then, as what he sought was not in sight: “Where’s
that School Catalogue?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Alvin started to reply, caught another view of his
roommate’s countenance, and forebore. Instead he
lifted the blue-covered pamphlet from the table, and
held it forth. Monty grabbed it, and leaned under
the light. “Catalogue of Grafton School,” he read.
“Calendar,” “Trustees,” “Faculty,” “Students.”
Here it was! “Senior Class,” “Upper Middle
Class,” “Lower Middle Class”: H’m! “Ainslee,
Ainsworth—” Where were the C’s? “Camp, Carpenter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Chandler, Christian, Clapp, Cook, Crail——”</p>

<p>There it stood in all its enormity!</p>

<p class="noic"><i>Crail, Abijah Montfort. Terre Haute, Ind. M., F.</i><br></p>

<p>Monty stared at it a minute. Then he closed the
pamphlet gently, and laid it aside. Alvin was regarding
him with a doubtful grin. Monty faced him
sternly.</p>

<p>“My name <em>is</em> Abijah,” he said, “but I don’t choose
to be called that. Understand?”</p>

<p>Alvin’s gaze wandered away, but after a moment
he nodded.</p>

<p>“All right, then. Just remember that it’s going
to be awfully unhealthy for you if you forget that
fact, Standart.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t row with me,” grumbled Alvin. “I
didn’t name you——”</p>

<p>Monty leaned forward, and waved a finger within
an inch of his roommate’s nose.</p>

<p>“You heard me!” he said.</p>

<p>Alvin looked for an instant cross-eyed at the finger.
Then he shrugged his shoulders, and took up
his book again.</p>

<p>Monty pulled his chair to the other side of the
table and squared himself for study. But he didn’t
do much. That beastly song of Jimmy’s kept echoing
through his mind.</p>

<small>“BULL RUN”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next day was Wednesday by the calendar,
and “Bull Run” according to the football
crowd. Whether it was intentional or not,
true it was that Coach Bonner invariably made
Wednesday practice something to remember for at
least forty-eight hours. That was his day for driving,
and every player went down to the field fully
convinced that, whether he lived to eat his supper
or not, he was not due to die of ennui. On Wednesdays
the scrimmage with the second went the full
sixty minutes, with no let-up save such as the rules
exacted, and no pauses for instructions. It was fight
all the way, from first whistle to last. On the whole,
“Bull Run” was by no means a misnomer.</p>

<p>On this particular Wednesday afternoon Monty
doffed his street clothes, and pulled his togs on with
misgivings. He wasn’t physically frightened, but he
was very doubtful of his ability to hold his own in
the real contest that was due. He walked from the
field house over to the gridiron with Blake and Ordway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
and he envied those experienced youths their
gay and careless spirits. Personally, he was rather
silent and preoccupied. He wanted to ask, yet
scarcely liked to, whether Manson was likely to play,
reasoning that if the regular fullback showed up, he,
Monty, was not likely to be called on. And, when,
a minute later, he descried Manson on the bench he
didn’t know whether to be glad or sorry.</p>

<p>There was no tackling of the dummy today. The
three squads went right to signal work, and Monty
found himself on the second, with Weston, Brunswick
and Hanser in the backfield with him. When,
in the course of plunging up and down the field, he
presently passed the first squad, he saw that Manson
was not playing, after all. Still later, on returning
to the side line, the fact was explained.
Manson leaned on a good stout cane when he walked
and limped perceptibly. The second team poured on
the field like a lot of colts, evidently fully primed for
their task, and, with a grim disregard of everything
save the business of the day, Coach Bonner summoned
the still breathless players from the benches.</p>

<p>“All right, First Team! Derry, Spalding, Kinley,
Musgrave, Gowen, Gordon, Tray, Blake, Winslow,
Ordway and Caner. Take the east goal and
kick off to the second. Burgess, you all ready?
Boynton, you find another fellow and hold the chain
on this side. Hurry them, Burgess. Get to work!”</p>

<p>Monty sighed his relief when he heard Caner’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
name instead of his, and he settled back on the
bench, with his blanket snuggled around him, resolved
to be very attentive, and learn all he might
from watching the way Caner played. But that
mode of imbibing knowledge was speedily denied
him, for Manson limped up the moment the game
had started.</p>

<p>“Crail, get a ball, and come over here, will you?
Willard, you’re wanted, too.”</p>

<p>Wonderingly, Monty received a ball from the
trainer, and, accompanied by Willard, a big, solid
upper middle fellow, who ranked as third-string center,
followed Manson. The latter led them to the
end of the stand.</p>

<p>“Bonner wants you to learn to get the ball from
center, Crail,” he explained. “We’ll be using the
direct pass a good deal from now on, and you’d
better be able to handle it. Willard, you go on
about eight yards, please. Whoa, that’ll do! Now,
Crail, get in place. Squarely behind, please. That’s
the ticket. End run on the left first. No, no; don’t
hold your hands out. Hide the play until the ball
is coming. All right, Willard. One, two, three—
Let her go! Get it, Crail! Shoot now! Hard!
Run, you rascal! All right! That’s pretty good,
but you want to be ready to start the minute the
ball gets to you. Tuck it under your arm and swing
off with the same movement. Here, I’ll show you.
Oh, confound this leg! Snap her, Willard!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>Manson, having discarded his cane, poised himself,
and when the ball, turning lazily over and over,
came to him, with one motion slammed it into the
crook of his left elbow and started away. The next
moment he was full-length on the ground, but, as
Monty observed, still held the ball. Monty helped
him to his feet, and Manson ruefully shook his head.</p>

<p>“I guess I can’t give practical demonstrations,”
he said, with a laugh. “Here you are, Willard.
Now, try that again, Crail. You see what I mean
by doing it together? You mustn’t lose any time
doing those two things separately. Swing the ball
under your arm, and step off with your left foot at
the same instant. The two moves work right together.
All right, Willard. One, two, three— Let
her go!”</p>

<p>“Better,” he commented, a moment later, “but
you must cut out that little hop with your right foot.
Swing your left right out. Get your stride at once.
That first step’s going to be shorter than the others,
but learn to cover ground with it, just the same.
Every fraction of a split-second counts, Crail.”
Manson snapped his fingers. “Bing! You’ve done
a yard! Bing! Bing! You’ve done two yards!
Speed, speed, Crail! That’s what counts, laddie!
Once more, please!”</p>

<p>“You got it that time. That was a lot better.
Now try it to the left. Remember that you still step
off with your left foot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“Left?” inquired Monty.</p>

<p>“Always when you take a pass from center to run
right or left, Crail, because the ball goes under your
arm. If you’re going straight ahead or nearly
straight, so you carry the ball against your stomach,
start naturally with your right foot. Now then,
you’re running the left end. Ready, Willard!”</p>

<p>Once or twice there came a poor pass which
Monty failed to get or, getting, mishandled, and
once he fumbled a perfectly clean throw. But his
catching was good, on the whole. After awhile he
was moved closer to Willard and at one side and
took the ball at an oblique pass. “The play’s a
shift,” explained Manson, “with you three backs
strung out in a line. At the ‘Hep!’ your quarter
falls back and the ball shoots to you and you slide
off their guard on the opposite side. Willard, you
step forward as though you were breaking through.
Your play is square over the spot Willard stands
now, Crail. That’s that ‘44, 44’ shift, with ball to
right half or fullback. I want you to get that pat.”</p>

<p>After a half-hour or so—Monty knew that it was
about that time because the teams were back on the
benches when he had time to look—Manson called
a halt. “That’ll do for this time. Much obliged,
Willard. Now, Crail, I’m going to talk a little
while.” He limped back around the grandstand and
sank onto a seat away from the bench. “Sit down
and get your breath. Bonner may be wanting you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
in the next quarter. Crail, you strike me as a chap
who was intended to play fullback and play it well.
What I don’t understand is how you got into the
line in the first place. Didn’t you ever think you’d
like to play behind?”</p>

<p>“Never thought much about it,” answered Monty.
“All the playing I’ve ever done was last fall at the
military school out in Indiana. I didn’t know anything
about football when I struck there and only
went out because they got after me. They stuck me
at tackle and I didn’t set the world on fire so you’d
notice it.”</p>

<p>“Well, tackle wouldn’t be a bad place for you on
a team that played a hard running game, Crail, but
you’d be a misfit in that place with a team that played
the plunging game. No, I think you’re meant for a
fullback. Now I’m going to tell you something, and
I don’t want you to breathe it to anyone before the
Mount Morris game. That a bargain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, Manson.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m out of it for this season. I might
play, I suppose. Doc says I may and Bonner thinks
I’m going to. But I’m not. I’ve only got one knee on
that leg, Crail, and next fall I’ll be at Dartmouth.
My brother made a name for himself at Dartmouth
and I’m expected to follow his example. Well, if I
do I’m not going to do it with a bum knee. No, sir,
that knee is going to have a rest from now until next
fall. It may sound as though I was going back on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
the school, Crail, but I don’t figure it like that. I
know well enough that I could go into the Mount
Morris game and play for awhile. Maybe I’d last
the game through. But if I did play this knee of
mine would never be any real good again. I know
that. Doc’s as good as said so. I want Grafton
to win, you bet, but I’m not flattering myself enough
to think that she can’t win without me. She can.
Caner can play well enough, and there’s Fenton and
you. If I take care of this old leg I’ll have four
years of football at college. If I don’t I’ll have to
get my letter on the Chess Team. Not only that:
I might have a weak knee all my life, and that’s too
much of a price to pay. Now, what do you say?
Think I’m a squealer?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” answered Monty thoughtfully.
“I think you’re sensible, more sensible than
most fellows would be about it. And I have a hunch
that it’s a lot harder for you to give up playing the
rest of the season than you’re letting on.”</p>

<p>“It is,” acknowledged Manson wryly. “It—well,
it sort of hurts, Crail!” He was silent a moment.
Then: “Sometimes I think I’ll take a chance,” he
muttered. “I might get through all right. With
a good pad—” His voice dwindled into silence
again. Then: “Well, what I was getting at was
that you’ve got a pretty fair chance to make a killing,
Crail, if you buckle down and learn the—the
fine points. It isn’t likely that Caner would play<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the Mount Morris game through. That bunch
play hard and a back is likely to be pretty well used
up by the end of the third period, if not before.
Fenton’s all right, but he doesn’t carry enough
weight for the job; or, rather, his weight isn’t low
enough; he doesn’t keep his feet very well. So you’d
probably get in if Caner came out. That’s something
to work for, Crail, because you’d get your
letter, if you didn’t do any more, and getting your G
in your lower middle year is quite a feat. I’m telling
you this because I want you to make good. I’ll do
everything I can to help you along. I owe it to the
team and the school to find a good substitute if I—desert
them.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Monty. “That’s mighty nice of
you, and of course I’d like to make good; but I’m
kind of scarey, Manson. Suppose I didn’t. Suppose
I just—well, just made a beastly mess of it.
You see, I haven’t played much.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have played much by that time,” said
Manson grimly. “You’ll find yourself about the
busiest chap in school, I guess. You’ll probably
want to quit more than once, Crail. It won’t be any
picnic, old man. But you won’t quit, because—well,
because I guess you’re not the quitting kind. Besides
that, you’ll want to do your bit against Mount
Morris. It’s a chance that—There’s Bonner calling
you!”</p>

<p>“Go in for Caner, Crail,” directed the coach when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
Monty trotted up. “Show a little more speed today.
Play as though you meant it!”</p>

<p>The third quarter was nearly over. Caner, just
about exhausted, made no demur at being taken out
and handed over his head-guard with a weary air
of relief. Monty pulled it on and encountered the
glaring gaze of Weston, who had taken Blake’s place
at the beginning of the second half. It was evident
that friendship had ceased, for Weston snarled,
“Now, for the love of Pete, Crail, show something!
Don’t die on your feet! All right, fellows! Let’s
have this!”</p>

<p>Neither side had scored. Substitutions had already
been numerous on each team. Coach Bonner
was driving the first relentlessly, while beyond the
panting, restless lines, Dinny Crowley’s voice barked
incessantly. The first had lost the ball on a fumble
and the second had been slamming into the guard-tackle
holes for short gains and had edged the pigskin
back to the first team’s twenty-nine yards.
Monty, watching, tried to guess the play, but dared
not trust his judgment, and it was Captain Winslow
who gave the warning as the opposing backs shifted
to the left.</p>

<p>“<em>Right! Right!</em>” shouted Winslow. “Play in,
Pete!”</p>

<p>Then the ball went from Monty’s sight, the backfield
divided and the linesmen crashed together. For
a moment the point of attack was in doubt. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Monty, hesitating, saw that Winslow had predicted
correctly. Hanser was already skirting the broken
line and Monty followed. The right side of the
second’s line was swinging around behind the runner.
Monty saw Pete Gordon go down, saw Tray try
for a tackle and miss. Then the runner was crashing
toward him. Hanser had overshot the hole and it
was Monty who took the brunt of that rush. The
second team back went into him like a runaway
horse, but Monty got his grip and, grunting as he
was borne back under the impetus of the charge,
held desperately. For an instant the enemy ploughed
on, but then something that felt like a ton of bricks
banged into Monty and he and the runner said
“Ugh!” in the same breath, stopped, toppled and
went over, the runner grunting “<em>Down!</em>” as he disappeared
under a half-dozen bodies.</p>

<p>“Up! Up!” cried Weston. “Our ball, sir!”</p>

<p>“Second’s ball,” corrected Burgess, somewhere
in the entanglement. “Second down! About seven
to go!”</p>

<p>“All right! Signals!” chanted the opposing quarter.
“Give it to ’em again, Second! They’re soft
and mushy! Easy picking, fellows, easy picking!
Signals!”</p>

<p>Again came the attack and Longley, at center,
was toppled aside. But the backs stopped the runner
for less than a yard gain. Third down now, and
six to go. “Watch for a forward, First!” warned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Winslow. “Spread a little, Hanser!” But the second
chose to punt and Monty trailed back under the arching
ball, warily, facing about at every other step to
watch the oncoming enemy. Then the ends were
threatening and he tried to get the first and failed,
recovered in time to send the other sprawling, went
down himself under the charge of a big second team
lineman, scrambled to his feet again to find the
tide flowing back toward him and did his best to get
into the hasty interference. But Weston, ball in arm,
slipped across the field, with only Hanser on his
flank, and, turning, twisting, gaining and losing, was
finally brought to earth near the side line after a
twelve-yard run back. And before the next play
could start the whistle piped.</p>

<small>TACKLED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The water bucket was set on the field and the
teams plied the dippers, the trainer watching
like a hawk to see that no more than a drop
of the ice-cold water passed down the parched
throats. Monty rinsed his mouth out, struggling
against the temptation to swallow the delicious fluid,
and followed his teammates across the center line.
Weston was scolding hard and Captain Winslow
was helping.</p>

<p>“You’re playing like a lot of mutts!” stormed
Weston. “You’re letting those dubs jump you every
time! You’ve got to score this quarter, First! You’ve
got to do it!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” seconded Winslow. “We’re perfectly
rotten. Let’s show ’em some real football,
fellows. There’s fifteen minutes more and we ought
to score twice. Just a minute, Gus.”</p>

<p>Captain and quarter conferred aside. The second
formed again. Taunts, mostly good-natured but
some frankly hostile, passed from the rival groups.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
Tired, strained faces glared or grinned. Then the
inquiry came again, “All ready, First? All ready,
Second?” The whistle blew. Weston barked his
signals. Winslow and Hanser and Monty shifted
to the right. The ball snapped back to Weston. The
backs plunged in tandem, and Winslow, the oval
snuggled to his stomach, went smashing forward.
But there was no hole for him.</p>

<p>“Second down! Nine and a half to gain! On
side, Left End!”</p>

<p>Monty was called on then for a slide off left tackle
and gained a scant two yards. Weston was on him
the instant he was pulled to his feet again. “Don’t
quit like that, Crail!” he stormed. “Fight, can’t
you? Fight or get out! Where were you, Hanser?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly rotten, First!” growled the coach.
“Every one of you was asleep. Hold up, Quarter.
We’ll try some new blood. Mann! Train! Hurry
up! That’ll do, Spalding and Bellows. All right
now. Go ahead. Show some football if you know
any, First.”</p>

<p>Winslow made four around his own side and then
kicked to the second’s twenty. Second came back a
scant five and began to hurl her backs at the first
team’s left guard. Twice she piled through for
gains. Then she was held. An attempt around
Tray’s end lost four yards and she punted short to
the middle of the field. Hanser caught but was run
out for no gain. Captain Winslow retired in favor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
of Brunswick and the newcomer made six on his first
attempt through center. Weston followed with two
in the same place and Monty hammered out three
more off tackle. Brunswick’s forward pass to Tray
went wrong and the second captured it on her twenty-eight
yards. Time was called for an injury to a second
team back. Weston went out and Blake replaced
him. Second gained seven on a forward pass and
then the rest of her distance on a fake-kick play that
sent the fullback around the first team’s left end.
Mann was badly fooled and it was Monty who made
the tackle. For once he had sensed the play in time.
He was congratulating himself on his acumen when
he heard Coach Bonner’s voice beside him.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to get into that, Crail?”</p>

<p>“I saw it coming, sir,” panted Monty.</p>

<p>“Oh, you did? Then why didn’t you tip off your
side? Why keep a good thing to yourself?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t certain,” faltered Monty.</p>

<p>“Be certain! You’re expected to learn what
they’re up to and signal it! Get on your job!”</p>

<p>Monty went back to his place ruefully, but there
was no time for nursing hurt feelings. The second,
encouraged by their success, were fighting more desperately
than ever. Only six minutes remained now.
She reached the fifty-yard-line on six plays, most of
them on Longley. The latter was pretty badly
bruised up and Little took his place. A penalty for
holding set the second back and eventually produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
a kick on third down which Blake gathered in on his
twenty-two yards. The second team ends smothered
him before he could get under way. Blake used
Monty on a line-buck that produced four yards and
then tried a quarterback run that failed. Brunswick
punted to the second’s forty. A back got away
around first’s left end and was toppled over by
Blake after a sixteen-yard romp. Second tried the
center again and found no gain. A forward-pass
netted the distance, however, and the first was fighting
desperately on her thirty-yard line. Monty discovered
suddenly that he was extremely tired and
that he had a fine big swelling over his right eye
and a cut on his nose. The second put in a new center
and two new backs and went at it again. Another
penalty for holding sent her back, however, and after
two short gains through the left of the line she essayed
a goal from the field with the kicker on the thirty-five-yards.
But the distance was too much for any
talent she possessed and the ball dropped short and
into the arms of Brunswick. The left half doubled
himself over it and plunged into the mêlée. Somehow
he got through, kicked a leg free from the
clutch of a second team end and had a clear field in
front of him. But Brunswick was not as fleet of foot
as Winslow and the second team quarter pulled him
down from behind just short of the forty yards.</p>

<p>“One minute and about sixty seconds!” called the
time-keeper as the teams faced each other again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“That’s more than enough!” shouted Nick Blake.
“Let’s have it now, First! Tear ’em up! Get your
gait! Show something for once!”</p>

<p>Brunswick pushed and heaved past guard on the
left for three yards.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, First!” encouraged Blake. “Once
more now in the same place! You can do it! They’re
groggy! They can’t stop you now! Signals! Kick
formation!”</p>

<p>Brunswick fell back and Monty slid into his place.
“Watch this!” shouted the opposing captain. “Watch
for a fake! Block hard, Second!”</p>

<p>Brunswick dropped his outstretched arms, swung
his leg. Hanser plunged straight ahead into the line.
Monty heard his “Ugh!” as he banged into a second
team player. Then he was grabbing the ball from
Blake, who had crouched to hide it, and was ripping
through the left of the second’s line, spinning as he
went in his effort to straighten out for the distant
goal. Arms clutched at him, he tripped over a fallen
player as he emerged from the broken line. There
was no time to select a course now. The secondary
defence was all about him. He could only go as hard
as he knew how, putting every ounce of weight and
strength into each plunging stride. He shook himself
free of one tackler by his very impetus and the
effort sent him staggering fairly into the arms of
another. But just as he expected to feel the clutch
of desperate arms around his legs he saw the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
crumple. Brunswick stumbled past in front of him.
Then he was free for the moment.</p>

<p>Recalling that other run, when he had fled from
one of his own side, he saw now that there had been
nothing ridiculous in it after all. He might do the
same thing now for all he could tell, for there was
no time to look back. He knew that feet were pounding
along behind him, although he couldn’t have said
that he heard them. When one’s mind is very busy
planning how to escape trouble ahead the faculties
refuse to interest themselves in what is going on behind.
Monty was wondering what would happen
when he reached that determined looking quarterback
ahead. Should he try to sidestep or should he
try to dodge or should he go at him full-tilt, trusting
to beat him down by weight and speed? Whichever
it was to be, it must be done soon, for already
the quarter was treading warily toward him, his
hands unconsciously clutching emptily in anticipation
of closing around the runner’s legs. Monty couldn’t
remember having ever encountered a fellow whose
whole appearance was more distasteful to him! He
hated him with a big and burning hatred! And
hating him so intensely, he found new determination
to outwit him.</p>

<p>The last line was surprisingly near. There were
the padded goal posts just ahead. To be stopped
now would be criminal. He pressed the ball more
tightly to his thumping ribs and stretched his right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
hand before him. But that beast of a quarterback
meant to tackle from the left. Well, then he must
shift the ball. But that is no easy matter when you
are running as hard as you know how, and Monty
funked it for an instant. Then time was almost up,
the quarter was nearly on him. Desperately he
groped for the pigskin and slid it quickly across and
into the hollow of his right elbow. It slowed his
stride, but only for the instant. Then he was staring
into the hated, anxious eyes of the enemy. And then
came the tackle.</p>

<p>Monty tried to meet the quarter with his left hand
as the former dived for his legs. But the quarter
got under the straight-arm and Monty felt the sudden
shock as the enemy’s body hurled itself into his
path. He swerved to the right, dug one heel hard
into the turf and pivoted on it. An arm was across
him, clutching, but the body was out of his path. The
fingers closed on his knee padding, held, slipped,
held again. Monty stumbled, turned around,
wrenched loose, went falling backward. The quarter
was on the turf, a queer huddle of khaki and scarlet.
Monty seemed to go on staggering for minutes before
he finally fell. The earth rose and knocked
the breath from him and he wanted to lie there and,
in his own quickly uttered phrase, “call it a day,”
but he found his legs soaring above him as he turned
completely over and then he was on one elbow and
one knee again and it was as easy to get up as to stay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
there! And so he pushed the turf away from him
with his free hand and found his feet under him once
more and went staggering ahead across the remaining
five white lines. As he saw the third disappear
beneath him he became sensible of renewed danger.
Footsteps raced beside him. He looked over his
shoulder anxiously into the detestable face of the
quarterback. He tried to hurry and couldn’t, tried
to swerve away from the enemy. Then arms were
locked tightly about his thighs, slipped to his knees
and closed there like a vise. Monty clung to the ball
and shuffled, even managed two short strides. Then
it was all up. A trampled, yellow-white streak
shot up into his face, he had just sense enough to
fend it off with his hand and elbow and there was
a crash.</p>

<p>This time, though, Monty had not run the breath
from his body, and after the first short instant of
shock he began to work himself onward, pulling the
clutching quarter with him, inch by inch toward that
last white line somewhere ahead. He heard the
enemy panting incoherent words of remonstrance,
but he paid no heed. It seemed to him that his one
remaining duty in life was to somehow pull himself
on and on until he came to the goal line. He was
still squirming, digging the point of a sore elbow into
the turf, when voices reached him.</p>

<p>“Get up, Stanley! They made it. Good work,
son.” Someone seized Monty’s arm and pulled him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
to his knees. Still clutching the ball, he looked up
at Nick Blake.</p>

<p>“He got me!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Someone else put an arm about him and raised him
to his unsteady feet. Players were all about him.
Others were trotting up.</p>

<p>“Bully work, Crail!” Blake was saying, thumping
him on the back. “Ata boy!”</p>

<p>Monty grinned weakly. “I nearly did it,” he
panted. “That Indian——”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. Where the dickens was the
goal line?</p>

<p>“Nearly did it be blowed!” said Brunswick. “This
is good enough, old scout. If I can’t lift it over from
here you may kick me around the campus. You take
it out, Nick.”</p>

<p>Monty stared stupidly at the goal line. It was a
full two yards behind him! It suddenly dawned on
him that he had gone over after all! He took a
long breath.</p>

<p>“Well!” he gasped. But no one heard him. He
followed his teammates back to the field, leaving
Blake kneeling on the ball five yards to the right of
the nearest goal post. The second was lining up dejectedly
along behind the line. Mr. Bonner, hovering
nearby, nodded across. “Nice run, Crail,” he
called. Others said so, too, patting his tired back,
grinning delightedly. Then Blake walked out with
the ball, stretched himself on the ground and pointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
for Brunswick. And Brunswick neatly and easily
lifted the pigskin across the bar while the second
came plunging and leaping impotently out from
under it. A scant forty seconds remained, barely
long enough for the second to kick off again, and
then they were all crawling tiredly to the field house,
the first team joyous and happy and the second
taciturn and disappointed. And on the way, while
Weston was telling him what a corking run he had
made, Monty was inwardly smiling. He had nearly
wrenched himself apart at the waist trying to crawl
along with that ball when he was already two yards
past the line! Would he ever, he wondered, stop
making a fool of himself?</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he passed that second team quarter
on his way to the showers. They each smiled.
Monty was surprised to find that the quarter was a
remarkably nice-appearing chap, after all!</p>

<p class="cap">“‘Hail, the conquering hero comes!’” chanted
Jimmy when Monty pushed open the door
of Number 14 Lothrop after supper that
night.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Monty shied a book at him. “I’m going to lick
someone pretty quick,” he threatened, “if I hear any
more of this name business.” But the threat didn’t
sound convincing, and Jimmy, as he rescued the battered
book, only grinned. Dud ostentatiously dusted
a chair and pushed it forward, and Leon, who had
followed Monty into the room, accepted it, murmuring
graciously: “So kind of you, I’m shuah!” But
Dud fell on him indignantly and he was glad to slide,
squealing, to the floor. When order had been restored
Jimmy demanded a full and explicit description
of how it felt to be a school hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you have a sort of a glow, eh? A—a
feeling of—of exaltation. It must be fine to float
around over the heads of us lesser dubs——”</p>

<p>“Cut out the low comedy stuff, Jimmy,” begged
Monty. “I came up here for a dime’s worth of sympathy
and all you hand me is a lot of silly guff.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, dearie. Come across with the sob stuff.
What’s blighting your young life?”</p>

<p>“Standart,” said Monty drearily. Leon choked
on a gurgle of amusement as Monty turned an accusing
look toward him.</p>

<p>“What’s he done now?” inquired Dud. “Slept in
his shoes?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s gone and bought himself a piccolo!”</p>

<p>“A piccolo!” echoed Dud ecstatically.</p>

<p>“Let him eat it,” advised Jimmy. “Maybe it’ll
choke him. Hope it does, too. Any fellow who will
eat pickles——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a silly gopher,” growled Monty. “You
don’t eat the things. You play on them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought a piccolo was a young pickle,” replied
Jimmy innocently. “What do you play on them
for?”</p>

<p>“To make a beast of a noise, I suppose. I don’t
know any other answer. He just got it——”</p>

<p>“A piccolo, Jimmy,” explained Dud carefully, “is
a musical instrument—” Monty snorted—“a musical
instrument resembling a flute. You might call
it a flutette. It——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve called it worse than that,” sighed Monty.</p>

<p>“It’s just one little octave higher than the ordinary
or garden flute and consequently it is just that
much more excruciating to listen to. Although history
does not reveal the origin of the piccolo, it is
generally supposed to have originated with the
Spanish Inquisition. If you survived being boiled in
oil and drawn-and-quartered and a few other exercises
you were serenaded by the Piccolo Quartette
and always died in frightful agony within four
minutes.”</p>

<p>“You seem to know a lot about it,” said Jimmy
suspiciously. “You don’t happen to have the piccolo
habit, I trust?”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for you chaps to joke,” mourned
Monty, “but if you had to live with one of the
things you wouldn’t think it so funny.”</p>

<p>“When did this piccolo appear on the scene?”
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Today. He just got it to worry me, I guess. He
can’t play it, but he’s going to learn, he says.” Monty
scowled around at the amused faces. “If that Indian
is found cold and lifeless in his bed some morning
you fellows will know the reason. Why, say, the
thing sounds—it sounds like a piece of Swiss cheese
singing to its mate!”</p>

<p>Unfeeling howls of laughter greeted the simile,
and Monty had to smile a bit himself. “Laugh, you
bunch of horned toads,” he muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you pinch it?” asked Dud. “Throw
it out of the window or drop it in the river.”</p>

<p>“I can’t get it without fighting him for it. He
keeps it in his pocket when he isn’t playing it and I
suppose he will put it under his pillow at night. The
only hope for me is that the other fellows will go
crazy and kill him. I shall insist on having the door
open when he plays.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you could do that,” Jimmy agreed
thoughtfully. “You could say that you just had to
change the air.”</p>

<p>Monty looked puzzled, but Leon laughed and Dud
smiled proudly. “Isn’t he clever?” he asked. “All
due to me!”</p>

<p>“Well, say, aside from this piccolette, or whatever
you call it,” said Jimmy, “everything remains
in status quo, so to speak, between you and the
fascinating Alvin? That is to say, old dear, he
hasn’t made any more threats about—er—you
know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that! No, I guess he’s decided to drop it. I
told him plainly that he would meet a swift and
horrible end if he told what he knows. He hates
me like poison, but I guess I’ve got him scared.”</p>

<p>“Well, scare him again,” suggested Leon. “Tell
him you’ll wash his face if he doesn’t stop playing
the piccolo.”</p>

<p>Monty shook his head. “I tried to scare him,
but it didn’t seem to work. He says he has a right to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
play a musical instrument in his room at any time
except study hour. I suppose he has, too. Joe
Mullins says so.”</p>

<p>“Best thing for you to do,” said Dud, “is get a
cornet or a—a French horn or something.”</p>

<p>“They’d sound the riot-call then,” said Monty
dismally. “No, the only thing is to kill him. I’ve
tried to think up some other scheme, but there isn’t
any. Say, do you suppose his parents are fond of
him?”</p>

<p>“You never can tell,” answered Jimmy. “Parents
are queer that way. There’s Dud, now. His folks
appear to be quite interested in him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dud has his points,” said Leon, “but it really
is strange to think that anyone could honestly care
what happened to Standart!”</p>

<p>“My theory,” said Jimmy, yawning, “is that
Standart has some—some hidden charm that we
don’t know about, some golden nugget within the
unattractive matrix of his—er—personality. It
stands to reason, fellows, for no one could be all
through the way Standart is outside. Why, just
think, if he’s like this now, what must he have been
at, say, five? No, sir, if he didn’t have some hidden
virtue his nurse would have dropped him down a
well!”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother Standart,” said Dud. “Let’s talk
of something pleasant. I heard today that Manson
is out of football for the season, that his leg is a lot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
worse than they’re letting on. Know anything about
it, Monty?”</p>

<p>“He was out at the field this afternoon,” was the
reply. “He coached me for a good half-hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he is gone for good it will play hob with
the team,” said Dud. “Manson’s the best fullback
we’ve had in years.”</p>

<p>“You forget that our friend, Mr. Crail, Mr. A.
Monty Crail, is some fullback,” remarked Jimmy.
“I’m hearing very good reports of him, very good
indeed. Bonner and I are very hopeful about Crail.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Monty will play a corking game when
he’s been at it a while,” replied Dud earnestly, “but
you can’t expect any fellow to step into Manson’s
shoes and walk off with them. Caner isn’t bad, but
he’s not in the same class with Manson. Besides,
who’s going to do the kicking?”</p>

<p>“Winslow,” said Monty. “And Brunswick. Brunswick’s
all right at goals and he’s a peach of a punter.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t put them over the bar the way Manson
can. We’ll be all right for punters, because
Blake’s a mighty good punter and Gus Weston isn’t
so poor, but if we lose Manson we’re going to be
squarely up against it when it comes to drop-kicking.”</p>

<p>“A few minutes ago,” remarked Jimmy, “some
gentleman present suggested that we talk of pleasant
things. Since then I’ve heard nothing but hard-luck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
yarns. I’m going where the atmosphere is less
humid. You fellows can stay right here, if you like,
and keep on weeping. Only please don’t get the carpet
too wet.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Leon.</p>

<p>“Over to Lit. Any other gentleman care to come?
All are invited. This is debate night and the finest
minds of the school will be on tap. The subject—well,
I disremember, but I think it’s—‘Resolved:
That one member of Literary Society is better than
seven members of Forum.’”</p>

<p>Dud howled derisively and the quartette adjourned
to School Hall.</p>

<p>The debate was not especially exciting to Monty,
and he couldn’t for the life of him see why the
speakers got so wrought up. After it was over he
left the others in front of Trow and walked home
to Morris, encountering two other occupants of that
dormitory on the way and finishing the walk in their
company. While they were still some distance away
they heard shrill and plaintive wails, and Monty
groaned.</p>

<p>“It’s Standart and his piccolo,” he explained. “I
have to live with it, fellows.”</p>

<p>“I’m hanged if I would,” said Denham indignantly
as they ran up the steps. “I’d pitch it out the
window.”</p>

<p>“And do it while Alvin was still playing it,”
chuckled his roommate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>Alvin was
seated at the table with a book of exercises opened
before him and a strained expression on his face.
The piccolo was glued to his puckered lips as he
turned to view Monty. The latter pretended surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you!” he said. “We heard the noise
and thought someone was pulling the cat’s tail. Say,
I believe you’re getting on with it, Standart. It
sounds a heap worse than it did before supper. I
guess you’re one of those fellows with a natural gift
for music, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>But Alvin made no reply. He only turned his
head away, fixed his gaze again on the music and
proceeded to evoke piercing sounds from the piccolo.
Monty tried not to mind it as he undressed, but
didn’t make a great big success of it.</p>

<p>“Gee, that thing must be suffering horribly,” he
said once as he wriggled into his pyjamas. “Oughtn’t
you to put it out of its misery, partner?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” gasped Alvin, rather short of
breath. “I’ve got a right to play this.”</p>

<p>“Sure, you have! I don’t dispute it, partner. But
let me tell you that many a man has perished for
the right before this.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of you,” replied Alvin, scowling
blackly. “I’ve got you where I want you, Crail.
Just you get gay with me and see what happens.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and just you let anything happen and see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
me get gay with you,” answered Monty grimly, as
he crawled into bed. Alvin muttered a moment and
then started off again. Monty bore it for five
minutes. Then he stifled a groan and said: “For
the love of mud, Standart, don’t torture the poor
thing! Kill it, if you want to, but don’t let it suffer.
Besides, <em>hombre</em>, it’s nearly ten o’clock and I want
to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and sleep,” said Alvin triumphantly.
“I’ve got a right to play this until ten, and I’m going
to.”</p>

<p>“Do you call that playing?” demanded Monty
peevishly. “What do you think work is, then? Isn’t
there any—any <em>music</em> in it? Isn’t there some note
you haven’t found that doesn’t sound like Sam Hill?”</p>

<p>“It’s all music,” answered Alvin in superior tones.
“I’m playing it the way it’s written.”</p>

<p>“Gee, did somebody write that?” asked Monty
incredulously. “What’s the composer’s name, Standart?
Does he live around here? Could I reach
him tonight?”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” growled the other. “You’re not
funny.”</p>

<p>Monty rolled over and drew the covers over his
head and tried to think about football and what his
chance of playing against Mount Morris was and
whether he could learn to play as well as Caner if
he tried very hard every day. But those frightful
wails from the piccolo would not be forgotten. Once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
someone pounded at the door and said uncomplimentary
things, but Alvin kept on blowing. Finally
Monty raised himself and looked across at the alarm
clock. It was ten minutes of ten. He wondered if
Alvin could last ten minutes longer. Then he wondered
if <em>he</em> could! He had had a pretty strenuous
afternoon and was dog-tired and wanted to sleep,
but sleep with that noise in his ears was impossible.
He stood it five minutes longer, getting more and
more nervous, and then swung himself out of bed.</p>

<p>“It grieves me, Standart,” he said seriously, “but
I’ve stood all I can of it. Chuck it now.”</p>

<p>“When I get good and ready,” was the defiant
reply. But Alvin watched his roommate from the
corner of his eye, nevertheless, and at Monty’s first
step in his direction whipped the piccolo out of sight.</p>

<p>“If you play another sob on the fool thing,”
said Monty, “I’ll chuck it out the window or break
it across my knee. I’m tired and I want to sleep.”</p>

<p>Alvin made no promise. He only stared insolently.
Monty went back to bed.</p>

<p>“Tweet, tweet, twe-e-et! Tweet, Tu-u-u-weet!”</p>

<p>“Snakes!” Monty reached the floor standing,
with the bedclothes wreathed around him. “I told
you, Standart. Now I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>“Keep away from me!” snarled the other.</p>

<p>But Monty rushed and, in spite of Alvin’s blows,
held him helpless. “You had fair warning,” he muttered.
“Let go of it! I’ll break it if you don’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“If you break it you’ll pay for it!” gasped Alvin.
“And I’ll fix you, Crail!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t fix—a ham sandwich,” grunted
Monty contemptuously. “Let go, I tell you! There!”
The piccolo was wrenched free and Alvin staggered
against the table. Monty strode to a window in the
alcove, thrust it up and hurled the instrument far into
the darkness. When he turned back Alvin was still
leaning against the table, nursing a wrenched wrist
in silence. But the expression on his face was so
utterly malignant that Monty marveled. “Sorry,
Standart,” he said, “but I had to do it. Hope I
didn’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” replied the other after a moment
in expressionless tones. “You warned me, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“And I warned you, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Warned me? What about?”</p>

<p>But Alvin made no answer. Instead, he began to
undress silently. Monty gathered the bedclothes
up and restored them to some order and once more
retired. But he was not easy in his mind. Standart
could make trouble for him if he wanted to. Perhaps
he had been foolish to increase the other’s enmity.
If Standart took that story to the faculty—but,
snakes, he wouldn’t dare to! Anyway, what
was done was done and meanwhile he was horribly
sleepy, and——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>Monty’s gentle snores were heard before Alvin
was ready for bed, and the latter, reaching to turn
out the light, paused in the act and looked gloatingly
across at the slumbering form of his roommate.</p>

<p>“Just wait!” he muttered. “Just wait, Crail!”</p>

<small>HOLLYWOOD SPRINGS A SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monty was back under Manson’s tuition
again the next afternoon. There was another
fifteen minutes of taking direct passes
from the center, during which Monty showed that
he had profited reasonably by his lesson the day
before, and then Manson began to teach him to
throw the ball overhand. “If you can start forward-passes,
Crail,” he explained, “it’s going to
make you just that much more valuable. I’m not
saying you can learn to do it awfully well in the
time we’ve got left, but I intend to start you right,
anyway. Now peg to Peet over there. Whoa,
boy! You’re not putting the shot! Easy does it.
Get your arm well stretched— Hold on, though.
You’ve got to get a better grip on the ball than that.
All your fingers against it, and the end against the
palm. If you want to hold it in the middle, all right,
but try this way first. You get more distance. Now
get your arm well up and back. That’s the ticket,
Crail. Keep your eyes on the goal; that is, Peet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
You’ll never get the ball where you want it to go
by looking somewhere else. Now throw your arm
over easy and let go when— Not bad, but don’t
run with it. Look here. Like this. One step’s
enough. Get it? Peet, you come in nearer, please.
We’ll try some short heaves first. No use trying
for distance until you’ve got direction.”</p>

<p>Monty threw until his right arm began to tire and
then Manson hauled him to the grandstand and seated
him there and went on with his instruction verbally.
Manson had the ability to put thoughts into words
very clearly, and Monty found that he was learning
many things he had never even considered. Finally
Coach Bonner summoned him to take Caner’s place
and there was a rather slow and frequently interrupted
quarter-hour of scrimmaging with the second.
Mistakes shown in yesterday’s game were recalled
to the memories of the offenders and, altogether,
this afternoon’s practice was distinctly onerous.
Monty hardly knew whether he performed well or
ill, so frequently was the game stopped for the correction
of some fault, and he was glad when the
whistle blew and released them. Manson fell in
with him at the side line and kept him company to
the field house, pointing out in his turn such errors
as he had observed. Manson had abandoned his
cane, but still walked with a noticeable limp, and
Monty was forced to slacken his pace to that of his
companion. Manson was very earnest, and although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
his pupil would gladly have postponed any
more instruction to the next day he listened patiently,
gratefully to Manson for the latter’s interest; Manson
ended the criticism with an antidote of encouragement
outside the field house door.</p>

<p>“Don’t get the idea that everything you did was
all wrong, Crail,” he said, smiling. “It wasn’t.
Fact is you showed up very well. You’re playing
rather a decent game. But I want you to be better
than just good, Crail; I want you to be a crack-a-jack.
And you can be, too, if you make up your mind to it.
I wish you could get more practice on throwing; it
would help a lot. Couldn’t you find a half-hour or
so in the morning? If you could get a ball and come
over here and put in even twenty minutes every day
it would be fine. Could you, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. I haven’t a ball, but——”</p>

<p>“I’ll find one for you. Suppose you took a certain
spot and tried to see how close you could come
to it from different distances, eh? Put your sweater
down and throw at that. Take plenty of time at
first. Later you can speed up. Accuracy is the
main thing, though. Try that, Crail, will you? I’ll
dig up an old ball and leave it at your room tonight.
You’ve got a full two weeks before the Mount Morris
game and you ought to be able to improve your
forward passing a lot in that time.”</p>

<p>Manson was as good as his word, and when
Monty returned to his room late that evening the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
football was reposing on his bed and Alvin Standart
was eyeing it curiously and distastefully. But he
refrained from questions, although Monty could see
that he was aching to know why Manson had walked
all the way from Lothrop to leave a scarred and
decrepit-looking pigskin. Silence was Alvin’s long
suit now. He seldom addressed Monty unless in
reply to the latter’s question, and such speech as he
indulged in was strangely devoid of offense. At
first Monty congratulated himself that Alvin had decided
to mend his ways, but presently the latter’s
unnatural silence and more unnatural politeness came
to have for him something sinister. Often he looked
up to surprise a brooding, ominous gaze from Alvin,
a gaze that made Monty feel absolutely squirmish
along his spine. “He stares at me like a snake,”
he told Leon one day. “It gives me the creeps.
I’ll bet he’s up to something slimy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he isn’t worth bothering about, Monty,”
Leon reassured him. “First thing you know he’ll
get on your nerves and you won’t be able to play
football.”</p>

<p>“He’s there already, I guess,” answered the other.
“Maybe that’s his game. All the time I’m studying
or reading I feel that he’s staring at me like a—one
of those things.”</p>

<p>“What things, you idiot?”</p>

<p>“Don’t remember the word. Something like balisick.
A sort of lizard, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, basilisk? There ain’t no such animal,
Monty.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there?” asked Monty dryly. “You come
over to my room and see if there isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Has he performed on the piccolo any more since
you threw it out the window?”</p>

<p>“No, I almost wish he would,” said Monty sadly.
“It would be better than his beastly silence. I don’t
know whether he ever found the thing again. If
he did he’s hidden it, for I haven’t seen it since.”</p>

<p>Hollywood School came on Saturday and sprang
a surprise. Hollywood had fallen victim to Mount
Morris two weeks earlier by the one-sided score of
20 to 3, and Grafton did not look for a very difficult
contest. Coach Bonner started the game with five
substitutes in the line-up, but before the second half
was well along he had to hurry his best players into
the breech. During most of the first period the two
teams gave a discouraging exhibition of football.
Fumbles were frequent on each side and mistakes
of judgment many. The ball changed hands continuously
and neither side threatened the other. It
was only in the last few minutes of the quarter that
any real form was shown, and then it was the visitor
who showed it. An unexpected forward-pass went
away for nearly thirty yards, finding Grafton’s backs
and ends asleep at their posts, and the enemy was
suddenly knocking at the gate. However, another
fumble turned the tide before the Grafton defense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
was thoroughly tested and the play went back to midfield.</p>

<p>In the second quarter Blake tried out two new
plays with poor success and Ordway made a thrilling
sixty-yard run from near his own thirty that placed
the ball on Hollywood’s threshold. Grafton’s supporters,
and they were many today since the whole
school had turned out and most of the village as
well, demanded a touchdown and settled comfortably
back in their seats—if they were lucky enough
to have seats—to watch the annihilation of the Hollywood
line and the securing of six points. But
nothing like that happened. Hollywood dug her
cleats in the turf and stood strong. Ordway, Winslow
and then Caner smashed at the wall and failed
to more than dent it, and the attempted forward-pass
across the line to Tray resulted in a touchback,
as Tray never even got a finger on it. Hollywood
kicked on third down from the twenty-five-yard line
and Ordway juggled the ball, finally being thrown
for a loss. Two attempts at the left end netted a
scant six yards and Winslow punted. The kick was
short and Hollywood secured it near her thirty-five
yards and began the march that surprised Grafton
immensely. Without losing the ball, the visitors
went straight down to Grafton’s eight yards, using
the simplest line-plays and concentrating on Grafton’s
left. Hersum, playing guard for Kinley, was
the weakest spot, although James, at tackle, was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
much stronger. The secondary defense worked
heroically, but Hollywood was not to be denied.
Hersum gave place to Little, but still the gains continued
and almost before the spectators realized
what was happening the ball was on the eight-yards.</p>

<p>Even then, however, the supporters of the Scarlet-and-Gray
refused to credit the possibility of a score.
Longley gave place to Musgrave at center and Hollywood’s
first attempt was thrown back. But a puzzling
pass behind the line followed by a slam at right
tackle netted four yards and backed the defenders
to their goal line. Hollywood faked a forward-pass
and the fullback carried the pigskin into Musgrave
for more than half the remaining distance. Another
charge by the same back, with the whole weight of
the visitors behind it, did the business after a long
moment of doubt. The ball was no more than
across when the pile-up was disentangled, but in such
a case an inch is as good as a yard. Hollywood
missed the goal widely.</p>

<p>Undaunted, the home team rooters cheered and
encouraged and told each other that such a jolt was
just what the team was needing to waken it up. But
it had no chance to show whether it was awake or
not just then, for Hollywood gave the ball to Grafton
for a kick-off and the half ended after three
plays.</p>

<p>“We’ll tear them up next half,” predicted Milford
to Monty as they followed the others to the field<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
house. “You wait till Bonner gets through roasting
us! We won’t have any hide on us, but we’ll play
ball!”</p>

<p>Coach Bonner did do some roasting, but it was
not of the hide-detaching sort. Perhaps the coach
realized that he was up against a far better aggregation
of players than had been expected. At all
events, he was not especially severe. Spalding went
back to his place at left tackle when they trotted
back to the field, and Derry and Hanrihan likewise
dropped their blankets. Save for the absence of
Manson at fullback, the line-up in the third quarter
was the strongest Mr. Bonner could offer. But it
wasn’t strong enough to keep Hollywood from adding
another touchdown to her score, from which, as
before, she failed to kick goal. Nor was it strong
enough to get the pigskin nearer the enemy’s line in
that period than her twenty yards. Still, in spite of
the one-sidedness of that third quarter, the home
team showed itself awake and played very good ball.
The difficulty was that Hollywood played better.
Just before the period was over Brunswick went in
for Winslow, and it was Brunswick who displayed
most of the ground-gaining ability of the Grafton
backs. Ordway was having a poor day and Caner’s
line-smashing looked pretty weak from the side lines.
Hollywood mixed two forward-passes up with a
long end-run in the process of securing her second
touchdown and got the ball to Grafton’s twenty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
yards. From there she gained two and three
yards at a time between tackles, making two first-downs
by inches only. She fumbled on the six yards,
but recovered on the ten. A wide end-run gave her
two of what was left and, on third down, she threatened
a drop-kick and then threw forward directly
between the posts for a pretty touchdown. Grafton
grumblingly referred to that play afterwards as “a
silly miracle,” and with good cause, for Caner and
Winslow were within arm’s length of the catcher and
the ball simply sped between their four hands and
into the grasp of the Hollywood man.</p>

<p>Grafton lined-up for the beginning of the last
period with the score 12 to 0 against her. She
started out desperately the moment she got possession
of the ball and tried every means in her power
to get down the field. Caner made a good rush of
fifteen yards and Brunswick later got twelve, but
once inside her own territory Hollywood was a difficult
proposition. Her defense against forward-passes
was so good that play netted nothing to Grafton
after the second period. Her ends were shifty
and wary and tackled surely. It was evident by this
time that if the home team was to even score she
would have to depend on line plunging. Twice she
reached the Hollywood thirty-yard-line and twice she
was forced to punt. Caner came into collision with
a Hollywood player soon after the quarter began
and, although he was speedily on his feet again and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
went on playing, he had to go off a few minutes later.
Monty went in with some ten minutes of playing
time remaining and an overmastering desire to do
something worth while for the fallen fortunes of his
team.</p>

<p>But it seemed that the opportunity was not to
come to him. An unlucky combination of off-side
playing and an error of judgment on the part of
Weston, who had taken Blake’s place at quarter a
minute before, wasted an advance of many yards
and made a punt necessary. What happened to the
middle of the Grafton line then will always remain a
mystery. Monty, playing up in Brunswick’s place
to protect the kicker, suddenly saw what looked to
be half the opposing team bearing down on him.
He accounted for one of the invaders, but his usefulness
ended then, for he was promptly knocked
down and walked on while the Hollywood players
descended in force on Brunswick before that youth
could so much as swing his leg. He was borne back,
ball in hands, and finally toppled to earth ten yards
behind his position, very peevish and still grunting
“Down! Down! Down!” It was a very miserable
fiasco, even though the referee put the ball back to
where it had been when Brunswick was tackled, and
it became more so when Brunswick refused to get on
his feet again and was subsequently carried off with
a sprained ankle!</p>

<p>Weston was a roaring, rampaging tiger-cat. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
was almost crying with anger as he tongue-lashed the
linesmen. “Now,” he ended up shrilly, “I’m going
to make this punt myself, and if a single Hollywood
man comes through this line I’ll hand him the ball
and walk off the field! You’re a bunch of big sniffling
quitters! You can’t play football for two
cents! Signals! Kick formation! Weston back!
Get in here, Ordway! Now hold that line, Grafton!”</p>

<p>That time the line held and only an end came
swinging around to dispute the kick. Ordway shouldered
him off and the heartening sound of meeting
boot and ball rewarded the anxious watchers. The
punt was not long, but it was nicely placed, and when
Hollywood got it she was down on her twelve yards.
She got back to the eighteen only before she was
forced to kick. Then Grafton turned the tables on
her and administered some of her own medicine. It
was Pete Gowen who broke through and leaped into
the path of the ball and Derry who caught the pigskin
on the bound and raced nearly to the last white
line before he was pulled down.</p>

<p>There were still four minutes of time, and the
cheers that thundered across the stands were heartening.
The team lined up, panting, desperate, on
Hollywood’s three and a half yards. Weston gave
the ball to Ordway, but Hobo was stopped in his
tracks. Hanser, playing at left half, got a scant
yard through center. Time was called by Hollywood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
and Mr. Bonner took advantage of the wait
to send Winslow back. Captain and quarter conferred
a minute. Then the Hollywood invalid was
jerked to his feet again and the whistle shrilled.
Winslow listened anxiously for the signal, and when
it came dropped back to kicking position. But the
play was plainly to be a forward-pass, and Hollywood
prepared for one. Monty jumped with the
others when the shift was called, and then the ball
sped back to Captain Winslow on a nice pass from
Musgrave, and Winslow poised it in his right hand
and edged back and to the right, apparently waiting
for a player of his side to get into position for
the catch. The Grafton line held well, but a tackle
got through on Ordway’s side while Winslow was
still edging back. There was a leap and Winslow
stepped aside, the ball still well poised. Monty,
hurling himself at an opponent, saw Derry speeding
across behind him. Then, as Derry reached the
dodging Winslow, the ball toppled back over the
edge of the captain’s upheld hand and fell into
Derry’s grasp, and the left end, running like a
frightened deer, sped on to the right, sighted a hole
and turned in, dodged a desperate opponent and
fairly raced across the line a yard inside bounds, and
was only tackled when he was half-way around to
the goal.</p>

<p>Winslow tried to add another point to the six and
failed badly, and the game went on again. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
time was almost up, and although the Scarlet-and-Gray
tried desperately to convert the Hollywood
victory into a tie, the final whistle soon ended her
hopes, and the visitors, after cheering breathlessly,
went contentedly off with the ball.</p>

<small>MONTY FINDS A SOFT PLACE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That 12 to 6 defeat dismayed the fellows, but
appeared to worry Coach Bonner not a bit.
Possibly he thought that an upset of the sort
would prove a blessing in disguise. The team had
gone through a fairly successful season prior to the
last contest, having met but one defeat, been tied
once and won four games. There had been evidences
of overconfidence and self-satisfaction, and
those are things that no coach cares to discern. Possibly
Mr. Bonner believed that the drubbing at the
hands of Hollywood would convince his charges that
they were not the finished team they had supposed
themselves to be.</p>

<p>They talked the game over in 14 Lothrop that
evening. Hugh Ordway dropped in soon after
Monty’s arrival to lug Dud off somewhere, but became
interested in the subject under discussion and
remained for half an hour or longer. Hobo was a
quiet-mannered, pleasant chap of seventeen, a senior
and a proctor. As he roomed with Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Winslow, he was credited with being “on the inside”
in football matters. Whether he was or not, he
never divulged anything of interest. Still, his opinions
had the weight of authority, and, when he made
them known, which was seldom, they were listened
to with interest. Tonight, responding to a question
from Jimmy, he said:</p>

<p>“How good Mount Morris has shown herself
against other teams doesn’t count much when it
comes to reckoning her chances with us, Jimmy. I
was looking over the records the other day and I
noticed that several times when Mount Morris had
won practically all her games and we had had rather
a poor season we won from her. And then, on the
other hand, we’ve lost to her more than once when
things were just the other way about. So the fact
that our deadly rival has won every game but two
and tied those doesn’t trouble me any. You can’t
tell a thing about a Grafton—Mount Morris game
until it’s all over.”</p>

<p>“Our team isn’t as good as it was last year,” said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“It never is,” replied Ordway, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, it really isn’t. We don’t play together.
I’m not a football specialist, but I could see this
afternoon that most of the time our fellows were
playing every man for himself, while those other
chaps worked together like machinery.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” granted Ordway. “That’s our main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
trouble just now. That and the fact that we haven’t
been able to develop much of an offense yet. The
backfield especially is ragged on team-play. But
we’ve got another fortnight, Jimmy, and it’s the last
two weeks that always count most. I feel like the
dickens about Will Brunswick, though. They say
he may not be in shape for the Mount Morris game.
He’s got a brute of a strain.”</p>

<p>“With Manson and Brunswick out,” observed
Dud, “our backfield is sort of shot to pieces.”</p>

<p>Ordway nodded. “It leaves us badly off for good
kickers,” he said. “That’s the worst of it. We’ve
got fellows who can rush the ball, but Manson is
our best goal kicker and Brunswick is the next best.
With both of them out we’ll have to alter our plans
a bit, I fancy. I dare say Bonner will try to coach
Nick on field-goals, but there isn’t much time for
it.”</p>

<p>“Can Caner kick?” asked Monty.</p>

<p>“He punts fairly, but he can’t drop. Too bad you
aren’t a drop-kicker, Crail. If you were you’d probably
have the call over Caner. You’re coming to
the table, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Ordway, vaguely. “I thought someone
said— Well, I must hop it. Come on, Dud.
Good-night, fellows.”</p>

<p>“That means you are going,” said Leon, when the
others had gone. “I’m awfully glad, Monty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>“So am I, if it’s so,” replied Monty. “But no
one’s said a word to me about it.”</p>

<p>“I fail to see that it’s anything to cheer for,” said
Jimmy. “Training tables are horribly monotonous.
Steak and baked potatoes, steak and baked potatoes
until you want to shriek. And no decent sweet stuff;
just rice pudding and soft custards. No pie or
cake; nothing but ‘gulp.’ Much better stay where
you are, Monty.”</p>

<p>But Monty didn’t, for Monday night saw him
installed at the training table in Lothrop, a regular
member of the first squad at last. He failed to get
Jimmy’s point of view as to the menu, for although
there was undeniably a certain lack of variety to be
observed, to him the “steak and potatoes, steak and
potatoes” tasted mighty well. Monty had normally
a good healthy appetite, and during the following ten
days that appetite was whetted by the hardest sort
of hard work, and the amount of steak and the number
of eggs that he caused to disappear would alarm
any housekeeper in the land if I divulged them.
Manson had left the table, which was accepted as
proof that he was of a truth no longer a possibility.
Brunswick kept his place, but went about on crutches
with his left foot bandaged until it was almost as
large as a football. The Saturday defeat caused
one or two shifts in the line-up on Monday, but the
shifts proved only temporary, as the deposed players
fought hard for reinstatement and ultimately secured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
it. Monty worked like a Trojan, urged on by Manson,
who seemed to center all his hopes of a Grafton
victory on his pupil. One would have thought from
the way in which Manson dogged Monty’s footsteps
that everything depended on the latter. The morning
practice had vastly improved his throwing, and
he was able to get off several good forward-passes
during the week. But that task was not often entrusted
to him; never, in fact, when Winslow was
in. Monty himself couldn’t see that he had made
any considerable strides in his playing, but Manson
gave him praise more than once, and Coach Bonner
proved his satisfaction by almost working Monty
off his feet. By the end of the week it was a toss-up
between Monty and Caner as regarded their playing
and as regarded their chances. Practically both
were certain of getting into the two remaining
games. The only question was which would be
given the preference.</p>

<p>The school was football mad by now, and mass
meetings to practice cheers and songs were held
thrice a week. Monty attended just one of them and
sat far back in the hall with Leon. He didn’t go
again because, as he explained, he felt like a fool sitting
there and hearing himself cheered. For by that
time they were cheering, not only the school and the
team as a whole, but the individual players and the
coach and the trainer and about everything they
could think of. One heard the football songs everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
and at all times. Fellows whistled them in
the dormitories, sang them on the campus and
banged them out on the pianos. Study suffered just
as it always did at that time of year, but faculty
was lenient. To Monty the week passed in whirlwind
fashion and almost before he knew it. If it
hadn’t been that he was thoroughly tired out by ten
o’clock every night he would have been too excited
to sleep. To him the one important thing in life now
was to satisfy Manson by his playing. After that, he
wanted to get into the Mount Morris game and he
wanted Grafton to win. He wanted that hard, so
hard that he convinced himself that Grafton <em>would</em>
win, that there was no chance of her not winning.
As to that events proved him wrong, but he was
happy in his ignorance.</p>

<p>Those were joyous days for him. He no longer
wondered whether he would have liked Mount Morris
better. He knew he would not have. He was
by now absolutely convinced that Grafton was the
finest school in the length and breadth of the land
and wouldn’t have changed places with anyone, not
even with the King of England. Being King of
England, he would probably have told you, was a
dull job compared with playing fullback on the Grafton
school football team! If there was one tiny
thing to mar his happiness it was the realization that
he was not making much headway in studies and that
he would have to buckle down and do a giant’s work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
after the seventeenth of November in order to get
that advance to the upper middle class. But he tried
not to think of that.</p>

<p>He saw less than ever of Alvin Standart now that
he ate his meals in Lothrop, which was probably
well for his peace of mind, since Alvin still gloomed
and glowered and enacted the rôle of the villain in
a melodrama. It would have been a positive relief
to Monty if Alvin had gritted his teeth and hissed,
in true melodramatic style: “A time will come, Harold
Montague!” But Alvin made no threats; he
only stared sullenly, gloatingly as it seemed to
Monty, and looked all the time like a silent threat,
to use Monty’s description. Monty sometimes likened
himself to a person seated on a keg of gunpowder
with the fuse sputtering. He wasn’t sure that
the fuse wouldn’t go out before the spark reached
the keg; but, on the other hand, he had the feeling
that that spark was going to keep right on smouldering
and that some fine day there would be a spectacular
explosion. The best he could hope for was
that the explosion would come after the Mount
Morris game!</p>

<p>The next to the last contest was with the Lawrence
Textile School at Lawrence, and just about every fellow
at Grafton accompanied the team that Saturday
morning. Last year Lawrence had won from Grafton,
17 to 7, and only the more optimistic expected
anything better than a close score, with Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
on the long end, or, at best, a tie. Monty started
the game at fullback and lasted until the end of the
half, by which time Grafton had pounded out one
touchdown with unexpected ease, and the opponent
had tried a field-goal and missed it. The Grafton
score came as a result of straight, old-style football,
most of the gains being made on the left of the Lawrence
center from a simple three-man-abreast formation
that was quick enough to frequently get the
jump on the heavier and slower Lawrence forwards.
Monty did his full share in that long, steady advance
from Grafton’s twenty-eight to Lawrence’s seven,
showing a dependability that pleased the coaches and
surprised himself. Considering his weight, he was
remarkably quick, and, once going, that weight, combined
with a lot of strength, made him hard to stop.
He had less success at running plays than with
plunges, for he had not learned to dodge and change
his pace well enough yet to elude the tacklers. However,
there was one creditable twelve-yard romp in
the second period that brought the total of ground
gained to respectable figures. From the Lawrence
seven yards Captain Winslow advanced six on a skin-tackle
play, and Hobo Ordway dived through right
guard for the rest of the distance. Winslow kicked
an easy goal after the punt-out.</p>

<p>That was in the last few minutes of the first quarter,
and during the remainder of the half Lawrence
played a far more stubborn game. Her forwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
awoke from their lethargy and her backs diagnosed
the plays better. Grafton never threatened her goal
again in that period. The best Lawrence could do
on offensive was to reach the Scarlet-and-Gray’s
twenty-two yards, and from there, after being thrice
held for almost no gain, she essayed a placement
kick and saw the pigskin go under the bar instead of
over.</p>

<p>Grafton, fully a hundred and seventy strong,
cheered and sang joyfully during the intermission,
and the Lawrence supporters answered from across
the field. It was a fine thing to end the first half
against a team as strong as Lawrence Textile with
the score 7 to 0, and Grafton proved that she was
aware of the fact by whooping things up loudly until
the teams came back.</p>

<p>Caner went in at fullback in the second half and
Weston took Blake’s place at quarter, but those were
the only substitutions made, and neither was a reflection
on the playing of the deposed players. Lawrence
started off in whirlwind fashion after Grafton
had kicked off, and showed that she was capable of
far better work than she had shown in either of the
first quarters. She worked Derry’s end for short
gains with discouraging frequency, until Derry was
taken dejectedly out and Bellows sent in. Bellows
did better, but it was rather the fact that Lawrence
chose to change her game that prevented more gains
around the Grafton left than any excellence of defense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
shown by him. Two forward passes in the
middle of the field paved the way for the final drive
that gave Lawrence her touchdown after twelve
minutes of play. That advance was twice halted,
but it ended at last in success, when the Lawrence
left half was hurled through Hanrihan for the final
scant yard after Grafton had doggedly retreated
from her five-yard line during three downs. Grafton
waited anxiously the result of Lawrence’s try at
goal. If she missed it the game was almost certainly
Grafton’s, they argued, while if she made it,
a tie was the best they could expect. There were
many groans when it was seen that the ball had
passed over the bar.</p>

<p>Grafton kicked off again to her adversary and
Lawrence again started on her long journey, but now
it was evident that her former drive had taken the
steam out of her, for she lost the ball soon after
crossing the half-way mark. Grafton went heroically
at work to break that tie and was punching holes
in the Lawrence breastworks when the quarter
ended. When play was resumed she got as far
as her opponent’s thirty-two and was then forced to
punt. Lawrence came back six yards and returned
the kick, Weston catching on his own thirty-eight.
Winslow punted on third down and Lawrence
caught near her twenty and ran back nearly to mid-field
behind good interference. Kinley was hurt in
a tackle and Hersum went in. Again Winslow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
punted on third down, and this time Tray downed
the catcher on the spot. A forward pass gained
twelve for Lawrence, and a second one grounded.
Then a wide end-run netted three yards and a skin-tackle
plunge two more. A fake-kick sent the fullback
around Bellows for more than the required distance.
After that the game see-sawed until Lawrence
was penalized fifteen yards for illegal aid to
the runner, and the subsequent kick rolled over the
line at the Grafton forty-two yards.</p>

<p>Then the visitors started a rally. Winslow heaved
a remarkable forward to Tray, and Tray romped
ten yards before he was pulled down and placed the
pigskin on the Lawrence thirty-three yards. Caner
got four through the left side, Ordway squirmed
through the same hole for three more and Caner
added another two. Winslow, running from kick
formation, barely got the distance. Another forward-pass
was tried, but Bellows was unable to get
under it. Caner tried the right end and was stopped
for a four-yard loss. Ordway got three off right
tackle and Winslow punted. Lawrence started back
from her five-yard line, but was forced to punt after
two tries at the end. Weston caught near mid-field
and ran back five. Caner went around the Lawrence
left wing for eight, but dropped the ball when
tackled, Spalding recovering it for no gain. Ordway
made four through center and was hurt. Hanser
took his place. The timer announced six minutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
left to play. Winslow smashed out three yards and
Weston made it first down by squirming through
center. The ball went to the thirty on three plunges
between the guards, and Lawrence sent in two subs
to strengthen her center. Weston was called out
and Blake replaced. Caner was stopped for no gain
and Winslow made a scant two. Hanser, on a criss-cross,
got through left tackle for seven. Winslow
faked a kick and Blake carried the pigskin around
the enemy’s right end for eight yards, putting it
down on her thirteen. Caner was again stopped for
no gain and Winslow’s forward toss to Tray went
wrong and was brought back.</p>

<p>It was at that juncture that Coach Bonner summoned
Monty from the bench. “Go in for Caner,”
he said. “Tell Blake to use you up and smash their
left guard and tackle. There’s a soft place there,
Crail, and you can find it. Go ahead!”</p>

<p>And Monty did find it. Twice he hurled himself
at the guard tackle hole on the right and twice he
went plunging, staggering through for good gains.
The Grafton supporters were crowding the ropes
now and cheering wildly. Coach Bonner sent in
Gordon for Hanrihan, James for Spalding and
Boynton for Winslow, the latter having played himself
just about out. Monty’s second plunge landed
the ball on the two-yard line for first down. Boynton
tried the other side for no gain, and then Monty
once more snuggled the ball against his stomach and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
lunged into the line. He got a yard. Hanser went
back as though to kick, but once more the ball was
Monty’s and once more he slammed into the enemy,
and this time he had the satisfaction of knowing,
when he went down at the bottom of the writhing,
grunting mass, that he was well over the line.</p>

<small>THE “BLUE”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">So Grafton took home a battered football and a
13 to 7 victory, and was vastly pleased, because
Lawrence Textile was no mean antagonist
and had won her previous games with Grafton
with discouraging monotony. Monty was bruised
but happy. Although none of the players had given
him more than a slap on the back and a word of
grinning approval, he nevertheless knew that he had
in those four plunges established himself on the
team. As Mr. Bonner would have phrased it, and
as a fact did phrase it, to Captain Winslow, he had
proved himself of first-team caliber. He didn’t have
to be told that he had at last drawn ahead of Caner
in the race. He knew it, and knew that next Saturday
he would start the game as fullback for the Scarlet-and-Gray.</p>

<p>And yet, as pleased as Monty was, it is doubtful
if he was any happier than Leon. Leon could talk
of little else all that evening, and I think Jimmy
was a bit bored by the conversation, even if he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
too polite or, perhaps, sympathetic to show it. They
had another concert in the common-room after supper,
with first Monty and then Forbes officiating at
the piano. In the end the concert turned itself into
a tumultuous, wildly enthusiastic cheer-meeting, and
the room was too small to hold all those who wanted
to get in.</p>

<p>There was another assemblage in School Hall
Monday night, but Monty didn’t attend. Nor did
any of the players. There was a blackboard drill
in the gymnasium that evening, and when it was over
the cheer-meeting had adjourned to the campus,
where, in spite of a twenty-mile wind out of the
northeast, some hundred and fifty hilarious youths
marched and snake-danced and sang and shouted
until authority in the shape of several regretful but
determined proctors put an end to the demonstration.</p>

<p>Monty thought, ate and slept football from Saturday
to Thursday. Coach Bonner had put a stop to
the morning practice at forward-passing, on the
score that Monty would be overworked, but Manson
still guarded and tutored Monty in his every spare
moment. Manson was walking as well as ever now,
but it had been decided that he was not to go back
to work. Brunswick, too, was out of it, according to
rumor, although it was more than likely that he
would be run in toward the end of the game as a
reward for his services and that he might be awarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
his G. The daily papers that contained accounts of
Mount Morris’s condition and that supplied prophecies
as to the outcome of Saturday’s contest were
eagerly awaited and perused. Mount Morris had
played Corbin in her semi-final game and had had
an easy time of it, winning about as she liked and
with a patched-up team in the second half. But Corbin
was not much of an opponent for a team of
Mount Morris’s power, and so the victory was not
viewed at Grafton with much awe.</p>

<p>There was a hard practice on Tuesday and another
on Wednesday, and Monty was driven inexorably
during most of each scrimmage. It was evident
to the coaches that his forte was working the
line between tackles rather than end rushing. He
was now able to start quickly and get well under way
before reaching the line, and when he got to it he
usually went through. And once through he was
remarkably hard to stop, for Manson had dinned
“fight” into him for two weeks. “You’re not
stopped until you’re pulled down or thrown back,”
Manson would say. “Just as long as you can put
one foot ahead of the other, Crail, keep going.
Every inch counts in the long run. Put your head
down, stick your shoulder out and keep on boring.
You’ve got the weight and you’re as strong as an
ox.” And Monty profited by the advice, and time
after time, when opposed to the second team, made a
foot or a yard or two yards after the enemy thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
him stopped. He really enjoyed plowing along with
two or three second team fellows clinging to his legs,
waist and neck, it seemed. Of course, he was not
yet a finished player. It would take more years than
one to make him that. But he did the very best he
knew, played every moment and could stand a heap
of punishment. And, thanks to Manson perhaps,
“died fighting.”</p>

<p>And so matters stood when, on Wednesday afternoon,
almost on the verge of the big battle of the
year, that blue envelope met his sight. It lay innocently
enough on the marble-topped table in the hall
of Morris House when he returned from practice.
He had never received a “blue,” as the fellows
called it, and scarcely took the trouble to read the
name on it. But he did read it, and having read it
bore it upstairs and ripped open the envelope with
only mild curiosity. Alvin was absent at the time,
perhaps intentionally. The single sheet of azure-hued
paper inside bore printed lines, and Monty
had to switch on the light before he could read
them.</p>

<p>“The Principal requests the presence of Mr. Crail
at the School Office at 4 p.m. Wednesday.”</p>

<p>His name and the hour and day had been filled
in by typewriter. Monty frowned a moment. Then
the meaning of the summons came to him and he
turned involuntarily in search of Standart. But Alvin
was not there. Monty folded the paper up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
placed it back in the envelope. Well, it would have
to be faced, he told himself. After all, it wasn’t
likely that they’d make much trouble now. It had
been so long ago that the importance of it had faded
in his mind. For the last few days he had almost
forgotten the prank and Alvin’s threats. Even now
he was inclined to doubt that Alvin had really told.
Perhaps it was only a summons to explain why he
had not done better in his studies of late. If Alvin
had meant to tell about those keys he would surely
have done so long ago. Unless——</p>

<p>Monty sat down rather weakly in the chair beside
him and stared at the “blue” with wide eyes.
That was it, of course! Alvin had waited until the
last moment on purpose, had all along planned to let
Monty set his heart on playing in Saturday’s game
so that the disappointment would be greater.
Monty’s hands clenched and a wave of red swept
into his cheeks. If only Standart were there! If
he could just get his hands on him! He started up
and was halfway to the door before the futility of
searching for the other came to him. First he would
make certain. After that—well, Standart couldn’t
keep out of his way for long!</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him to look at the summons
again. Hadn’t it said four o’clock? Yes, and it
was now after five. It must have arrived after he
had gone to the field for practice. He wondered
what he should do, and finally decided to go directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
to the office and explain. Doctor Duncan would not
be there, he presumed, but the secretary would advise
him. He felt very tired and rather dejected
as he walked across the campus in the twilight. Beating
Standart was going to be unsatisfactory recompense
for losing his chance to play against Mount
Morris!</p>

<p>Mr. Pounder, the secretary, was alone in the outer
room when Monty reached the office. He nodded at
the latter’s explanation. “Doctor Duncan left word
that you were to call at his house in case you came
before supper time. Otherwise he would see you in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go to his house, then?” asked Monty.</p>

<p>The secretary glanced at the clock and again
nodded. “I should,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You—you don’t know what he wants to see me
about, do you?” asked Monty, with his hand on the
door-knob.</p>

<p>“I think I do, Crail,” responded the other dryly,
“but I have not been instructed to inform you.”</p>

<p>“It’s that, then,” muttered Monty sadly as he
went back through the empty corridor. “Here’s
where I get it. Snakes, why couldn’t they wait until
after Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Will you tell Doctor Duncan that Crail is here,
please,” he said to the maid who answered the bell.
“He—I think he expects me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Will you step into the study, please?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>He stumbled into a darkened room at the right,
the maid turned the light on and went noiselessly
away and Monty seated himself dejectedly on the
edge of an uncomfortable chair and waited.</p>

<p>At a little after seven Monty climbed the stairs in
Trow and knocked at the door of Number 32. Only
the stout Granger was in. He looked up from the
book he was reading and nodded with gracious dignity.
“Hello, Crail,” he said. “Come in. Leon
hasn’t shown up since supper, but I guess he will be
along in a minute. How is the world treating you?
I say, what’s up? You look like a funeral!”</p>

<p>“Nothing—much, thanks. I’ll find Leon downstairs.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Granger went back to his book with
a sigh of relief. Visitors were always more or less
disturbing when a fellow wanted to put his mind on
a thing.</p>

<p>Monty met Leon halfway down the first flight
and turned him back. “Got something to tell you,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Well, come on up, then. It’s beastly cold outside.
I’m frozen. They had a window open behind
our table in dining hall.”</p>

<p>“Granger’s up there,” said Monty. “He’s sitting
in the middle of his web like a big, fat spider. We’ll
walk. You won’t be cold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! Well, all right.” Leon followed
the other down the steps with a shiver and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
turned along the bricks. “What’s your trouble,
Monty?” he asked lightly.</p>

<p>“I’m through,” said Monty.</p>

<p>“Through? Through what?”</p>

<p>“Through here. I’m on pro. Standart squealed.”</p>

<p>Leon stopped. “He did? Why, the—the—
But probation isn’t anything, is it? What do you
mean by saying you’re through?”</p>

<p>“Probation queers me for football,” answered
Monty. “I made up my mind that if they put me on
pro. I’d clear out. What I did wasn’t anything, anyway,
and it isn’t fair to sock it to me like this.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a silly fool!” implored Leon. “Why
should you leave school just on that account? It’s
a shame about football, but—but there’s next
year——”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I won’t be here,” responded Monty
quietly. “I’m going to settle things with Standart
and pull my freight.”</p>

<p>“But that’s crazy!” Leon expostulated. “Don’t
be an ass! Listen here, Monty. You’ve had a good
time with football and you’ve made the team. That’s
a whole lot, isn’t it? After all, you might not have
got much out of playing on Saturday, anyway. You
might have got a kick in the head or something right
after the game started——”</p>

<p>“Sure,” laughed Monty mirthlessly, “and School
Hall might fall on me. No, Leon, I’m through.
That’s settled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>“Well—well, what about me?” blurted Leon.
“Where do I come in? Think I want to stay on
here alone, you—you——”</p>

<p>“You won’t be alone exactly. Oh, I know what
you mean, and I’m sorry, but—there isn’t anything
else to do, Leon.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’re pig-headed,” corrected the
other exasperatedly. “There are plenty of other
things to do. You can stay here and behave like
a sensible chap and not like a—a kid! Lots of
fellows have been put on probation before this, but
they didn’t get mad and leave school. What will
Mr. Thingamabob, your guardian, say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He won’t care much. I told him
I might leave.”</p>

<p>They walked on in silence to the end of the bricks.
Then Leon nodded at the lights in Doctor Duncan’s
house. “What did he say, Monty?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not much. He was decent—in a way. Or
tried to be. The trouble is with Old Whiskers, Mr.
Rumford. He insists that I purposely put the keys
on his table, or whatever he calls it, to show my
disrespect. Well, I didn’t. I didn’t know it was
his study. I thought it belonged to one of the fellows.
I told the Doctor that, but I don’t think he
believed me. Anyway, Rumford insists on having
me punished and Charley says I’m to go on pro.
And that settles it.”</p>

<p>“But—but did you tell him it was just a joke?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>“I did. He said a joke wasn’t a joke unless it
was taken as one, or something like that. Oh, I’ll
give Charley credit for being decent. I think he’d
have let me down a heap easier if it wasn’t for
Rumford. Well, never mind. I thought I’d tell
you. I might leave sort of suddenly, you know. I
dare say Standart’ll make a fuss about being damaged.
He’s a low-down, white-livered coyote, anyway.”</p>

<p>“You’re certain Standart told Charley?” asked
Leon.</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell Charley. He told Rumford. I
found that out. I asked what possible evidence
there could be against me, sort of injured innocence
act, you know, and Charley said that one of the keys
had been seen in my possession. That means
Standart. No one else saw the pesky thing. I wish
he had more fight in him. It’s going to be like
whipping a puppy.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Monty! Why not go and see Rumford?
I don’t believe he’s a bad sort. If you told
him frankly that you didn’t mean to get him into it
I’ll bet he’d act decent.”</p>

<p>Monty shook his head. “No, thanks. He and
I aren’t on very good terms just now, anyway. I’ve
been rotten in English ever since Bonner put me in
at full. And I wasn’t very good before. No, he
wouldn’t believe me. Anyway, I don’t feel just like
licking his boots. I guess I’ve had enough of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
place, Leon. I’ve had a good time, all right, and
I do like the school, but I guess I’m hoodooed. Someone
put tallow on my feet and I can’t stay anywhere
very long.” After a moment he added: “I’m
going to miss you, old man.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll beat it, too,” responded Leon dejectedly.
“Only I wish you wouldn’t, Monty. Why
can’t you take your punishment like a sport and stay
on here? Look at all the good times we were going
to have. You know what you promised about
Christmas vacation, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I might visit you then, anyway,” said Monty.
“I don’t believe I’ll start anywhere else until the first
of the year. Well, you’re cold and we might as well
go in. If I don’t see you again——”</p>

<p>“Forget it!” exploded Leon. “You’re not going
to leave school, and you might as well know it!
You’re going to stay here if I have to go and tell
Charley!”</p>

<p>“He can’t make me stay,” replied Monty calmly.
“I’ve got a right to leave any time I want to.”</p>

<p>“Well, then—then—” But Leon halted helplessly.
Finally: “Then will you do this, Monty?
Will you keep away from Standart until tomorrow
and not hike out before tomorrow afternoon?”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?”</p>

<p>“Because I want you to. Because I ask you to,
Monty. You might do that much for me, considering
that you’re going to leave me all alone here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>Monty considered. “I’m willing to,” he said at
last, “but the trouble is that when I run across
Standart I may sort of forget.”</p>

<p>“Leave him alone until tomorrow. If you pitch
into him tonight there’ll be a bunch of trouble and
you can’t get a train until tomorrow, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“There’s one from the Junction, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be a silly chump! You’re not packed,
are you? And how would you get to the Junction?
Will you promise to wait until tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“Sure, if you want me to. I—I’ll stay out until
Standart’s in bed, I guess. Maybe it would be best
to tackle him tomorrow, anyhow. I could get him
outside somewhere. If I lick him in the room he
will squeal and everyone will come piling in. All
right, Leon. But if you’re expecting me to change
my mind, <em>hombre</em>, you’ll miss your guess.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I’ll chance that. Now come on
up to the room and keep out of mischief. Or shall
we go over and see Jimmy and Dud?”</p>

<p>“N—no, I guess not. What’s the good of peddling
your troubles? We’ll go up and make life
miserable for Granger. Maybe he’s caught a fly by
this time.”</p>

<small>“FIRE!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monty went back to Morris House just in
time to squeeze in before the door was
locked. In fact, Mrs. Fair was about to
perform that rite when he entered. “I heard someone
coming,” she said, “but I thought you were in,
Monty. You should have been, you know. Now
that you are on the football team you should try
very hard to be in bed by ten.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, Mother. I didn’t mean to make
it so late. It’s awfully cold tonight, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Very,” she agreed as she locked the door. “I
told Collins to leave the draft on a little tonight. I
wouldn’t be surprised to see snow in the morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s cold enough,” agreed Monty, from the stairs.
“It’s nice and warm in the house, though. Good-night,
Mother.”</p>

<p>Standart was not in bed when Monty reached the
room, but he was ready for it, chastely attired in a
pair of striped blue-and-white pyjamas. Monty
deigned him one brief glance and Standart, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
he strove to appear at ease, quailed. Then, probably
vastly relieved at Monty’s silence and disregard,
he laid aside the book he had been pretending to
read and crawled under the covers. Monty undressed
quickly, grimly pushed one of the window
sashes to its full height, turned out the light and
retired. But he wasn’t sleepy. There were so
many things to think of. Standart didn’t interest
him especially, although he knew that that youth was,
like himself, lying awake in the darkness. When
the time came he would attend to Standart very
thoroughly, but he felt no temptation to break his
promise to Leon. He thought about the trip home
to Terre Haute, settling in his mind the details of
packing and purchasing tickets and so on. But underneath
was the ache of disappointment. It was
nearly midnight when he at last fell asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that it must be morning when he
next awoke, but the windows showed only a twinkling
star or two in their purple-black squares. He wondered
sleepily what had disturbed him, and turned
over to burrow his head again into the pillow. But
full consciousness came in the act and he sat up,
sniffing perplexedly. There was a distinct smell of
wood smoke in the room. He knew the odor too
well to mistake it. Perhaps it came in at the window,
he thought. The room was very cold and he
hesitated a moment before he finally got up his courage
and pushed a shrinking leg out from under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
covers. Once on his feet, however, he jumped
across the floor and switched the light on, for the
smoke was thick at the height of his head. One
startled glance showed the room fairly blue with it.
It was thick enough to trouble his eyes and his throat.
Hurriedly he strode to the door and looked out, or
tried to, but such a billow of the acrid stuff surged
in on him that he followed his first impulse and
swung the door shut again. But then, taking a
breath, he once more threw it open and stepped into
the hall. There was a faint, dull-red glow showing
between the spindles of the railing, about the staircase
well. As he looked it died away, reappeared
and again waned. His ears caught at that instant
the faint but steady crackling of burning wood.</p>

<p>He shut his eyes very tightly, not so much to keep
out the stinging smoke as to concentrate his thoughts.
Then he turned and climbed the stairs swiftly to the
upper floor. There were three rooms there and on
the door of each Monty thumped resoundingly.</p>

<p>“Tappen! Farnsworth! Are you awake? All
out, fellows! The house is on fire! Don’t stop
to dress. Drag something on and hustle down.
We’ve got to fight it!”</p>

<p>He was plunging down the stairs again before the
doors up there began to open and excited questions
followed him. On his own floor he pounded at door
after door, repeating the same warning: “All out,
fellows! Fire! Get something on and come down!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
As he passed Number 14 he remembered Standart
and went in and shook, that youth roughly.</p>

<p>“Get up, Standart!” he cried. “The house is on
fire!”</p>

<p>The sleeper grunted, opened his eyes and stared
blankly at Monty. But that youth, having pulled
on his dressing gown, was already hurrying back to
the corridor. Joe Mullins, struggling into trousers
over his pyjamas, was already there, and the upper
stairs creaked under the flying feet of the third floor
fellows. “Have you telephoned to the fire department?”
demanded Mullins.</p>

<p>“Not yet. Will you do it? I’ll wake up Mother
Morris. Bring the extinguishers from each floor,
fellows. The fire’s in the cellar, I guess. Tap, you
beat it over and get the fellows in Fuller up. Come
on, now!”</p>

<p>They hurried down the lower flight in a smother
of smoke. Mullins groped his way to the telephone
and Tappan slipped through the front door on his
way to alarm the occupants of the next house.
Monty beat a tattoo on Mrs. Fair’s door, finally
opening it and calling. There was no reply, however,
and he swung the door wider and looked in.
The light was burning low and a glance was enough
to show that the room was empty, although the disordered
bed suggested recent occupation. The others
had swung open the door that led to the basement
only to retreat. Black smoke billowed out at them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
and filled their eyes and throats. Someone slammed
the door shut again as Monty strode past, choking
and with streaming eyes, and sought the kitchen.
A small passage with a door that opened on the rear
of the house intervened, and as he groped his way
through it the sound of crackling and roaring became
louder. And then two things happened simultaneously.
He faced the partly-open door of the
kitchen and saw the flames eating their way across
the floor and up the further wall and he stumbled
over something underfoot and went crashing against
the door with a force that at any other time would
have left him half-stunned. Somehow he saved himself
from measuring his length on the kitchen floor
as the door swung wide under his weight and, recovering,
stooped and groped at his feet. Then his
voice rang out.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp304">“Help here, fellows!”</a> But the others were close
behind him, and in a moment they were carrying
Mrs. Fair back to her room. “She’s fainted,”
Farnsworth panted. “I’ll look after her. You fellows
go on.”</p>

<p>Mullins joined them and they returned to the
kitchen and, covering their faces with crooked arms,
launched the contents of the three fire-extinguishers
at the flames. But the effect was no more than noticeable.</p>

<p>“That’s all we can do unless we can get water,”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>shouted Monty. “Isn’t there a hose somewhere?”</p>

<p>“It’s in the cellar,” answered one of the boys.</p>

<p>“Close the door,” said Mullins. “Maybe we can
keep the fire there until the engine comes.”</p>

<p>“Did you get them?” Monty asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, finally. It will take them ten minutes to
get here, though. Aren’t there some pails we can
get?”</p>

<p>“At the other house!” shouted someone. “We
can get the hose, too! Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Someone ought to telephone to faculty,” gasped
Mullins. “I’ll do it. You fellows go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Is everyone down?” asked Monty. “Wait!
How about the cook?”</p>

<p>“She’s all right. She’s in with Mother,” answered
Farnsworth. “Let’s get to work with buckets, fellows.”</p>

<p>They returned to the hall and as they crowded
along Monty’s gaze fell on the glass transom above
the dining-room door. It shone fiery red. He
turned the knob and took one hasty survey of the
room. Beyond the long table with its white cloth
flames were licking at the wall. He closed the door
again tightly and groaned.</p>

<p>“It’s worse there than in the kitchen,” he said to
Mullins, who was impatiently sputtering into the
telephone.</p>

<p>“Ring again, Operator! There must be someone
there! Hurry, can’t you? Hello! What? Oh,
is that you, Mr. Craig? This is Mullins, Morris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
House. This place is on fire.” Mullins was trying
hard to be calm and coherent. “In the cellar. Yes,
sir, pretty bad. I’ve telephoned to the department.
We’re trying to get water on it. All right, sir!”</p>

<p>Mullins hung the receiver up and dashed, choking
for the door. Outside, several Fuller House fellows
were running across the intervening lawn, scantily
clad, excited and curious. Monty shouted them
back.</p>

<p>“Get your hose, fellows, and all the buckets you
can find!” he cried. “Don’t run around like that!”</p>

<p>“They’re getting it,” one of them answered
breathlessly. “How bad is it? Where is it?”</p>

<p>But Monty was already hurrying across to where
a knot of boys was pulling the garden hose from the
bulkhead. In a minute they had it connected at a
sill-cock under the bay-window, but the water didn’t
come and someone remembered that it was turned
off in the cellar. The Fuller House fellows were
pouring out now, armed with anything in the shape
of buckets or pitchers they could find, and presently
a bucket line was established across the lawn and
the hose was spurting. At that moment the bell in
School Hall set up its clangor. It was Monty who
kicked in the little window to the cellar nearest the
furnace, where the fire had started, presumably from
an overheated flue, and directed the stream of the
hose. Someone found a step-ladder, set it against
the dining-room bay and climbed it, bucket in hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
only to topple off, with the ladder coming down on
top of him. But some degree of order and method
was finally established and the two dozen or so
youths made a courageous fight of it. By that time
other fellows began appearing on the scene, hastily
clad residents of Lothrop and Trow and Manning,
and Mr. Craig, the superintendent of buildings, accompanied
by the school janitor and his assistant,
also arrived. They had brought the two school apparatus,
tanks of chemical extinguisher mounted on
trucks and supplied with long lines of hose, and Mr.
Craig took command of the battle.</p>

<p>The window in the kitchen crumbled and the
flames, hitherto confined inside, burst out. Monty
was instructed to direct his energies with the garden
hose there while the chemical extinguishers were run
around to the front and the hose from them dragged
into the house. It was at this stage that the Grafton
Fire Department made a belated appearance with
much éclat and confusion. Several minutes were
spent in finding the hydrant and making a connection,
but at last two streams were playing on the fire.
Monty caught sight of Mrs. Fair and the cook being
helped along the sidewalk to Fuller. For the first
time he thought of his possessions. It seemed to
him that all the fire departments in the state could
not save the old wooden building and he wondered
whether it would be permissible to hand his job to
another and try to rescue his clothes and other belongings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
But if Monty had forgotten the task of
salvage others had not, it seemed, for already the
street in front of the house began to present an incongruous
appearance in the light of the street lamps
as chairs and couches and various articles of furniture
were borne from the first floor rooms and
dumped helter-skelter in the road. There were a
few things that Monty set store by, and, since another
could direct the inadequate stream from the
garden hose as well as he, he speedily found a substitute
and made his way through the curious and
excited throng to the front.</p>

<p>The front door had been torn off and in and out
of the murky interior of the doomed house the firemen
were hurrying. Two pulsing lines of white
hose writhed up the steps and into the lurid depths
of the building. A fat fireman with a helmet cocked
erratically on one side of his head was pushing the
volunteer salvage corps away.</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” Monty heard him vociferating.
“’Tain’t safe no more. Them walls is likely to come
down. Keep out, everyone of you!”</p>

<p>From where he stood, a dozen yards from the
house, Monty could see that the whole left side of
the house was destroyed. The firemen appeared to
be concentrating their efforts on the other half, trying
to cut off the flames at the hall which ran from
front to rear through the center. He looked upward.
The second floor windows showed dark, but smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
curled from them. He made his way around to the
far side of the house and looked at the window of
Number 14. The light that he had left burning
was out and the open window showed first black and
then dull red. He didn’t believe that the flames had
reached there yet, but as they wouldn’t let him past
the door there was no chance of rescuing anything.
Well, it couldn’t be helped, he reflected. Although
if he could find a ladder somewhere he could easily
get in at the window. A few fellows were prowling
around on that side, but no one paid any attention
to him as he lifted the doors of the bulkhead, fortunately
unlocked, and peered into the darkness below.
As he knew, there was a division wall between
this side of the basement and the furnace compartment.
Such tools as the lawn-mower and rake and
garden hose and ladder were stored there, and Mrs.
Fair kept her geraniums hanging against the wall
like so many scalps. The air was hot and acrid
with smoke, but no sign of flames showed as he
stumbled down the half-dozen steps. But once down
there the smoke was almost intolerable and the sound
of the fire, the hiss of water and the blows of axes
were deafening. But he put his hand readily on
what he sought and swung it from the wall and went
staggering up the steps with it.</p>

<p>The ladder was short and used chiefly to wash
windows and prune the few trees around the house,
but when Monty had it leaning against the side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
the building under his window he saw that it would
answer his purpose. The highest rung was a foot
under the sill, but he could easily pull himself up and
into the room. With his foot on the first round,
he paused. Then he took off the dressing-gown he
wore and dropped it beside the ladder. “No use
having that thing tripping me up,” he muttered.
Then he climbed the ladder. At the top a gust of
hot, evil-smelling air blew into his face, but he laid
hold of the sill, got a foot on the top rung and pulled
himself upward and into the room. Darkness that
was now and then tinged with a red-brown glow from
the transom filled the room, that and an almost intolerable
smoke. He wished there was some way
of making a light as he hesitated an instant at the
window, but he hadn’t so much as a match and
doubted if a match would be of any use in that murk
if he could find one. Taking a deep breath of the
clearer air at the window he dashed across to the
alcove and found a towel. This he dipped in the
pitcher and then wound hurriedly across his face
beneath the eyes. There was no way to fasten it, so
he held it with his left hand while, with his right, he
pulled open the drawers of his bureau. For the
next three minutes he worked at top speed, bumping
into things as, with closed eyes, he hurried from
closet to bureau, from bureau to window. He managed
to get his bag packed with clothes and a few
articles that he prized, and then, clasping it, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
dropped it from the window and heard it thump
against the ground.</p>

<p>He stayed there a long moment, the towel off,
breathing in lungfuls of fresh air. He wondered if
Standart had saved any of his things. Wondered,
in case he hadn’t what he valued most. He tried
to think of anything else of his own that was worth
bothering about and finally ducked back again and
secured a handful of underwear from a bottom
drawer and dumped it through the casement. Some
of the things landed against the ladder and hung
there ludicrously. Then the thought of Standart’s
belongings returned to him and he fumbled his way
back to Standart’s closet and swept an armful of
clothes from the pegs. Halfway across to the window
he stopped, assailed by a doubt. Where was
Standart? He hadn’t seen him once from the time
he had awakened him! He had not been with them
downstairs, nor had he shown up outside later!
Monty went quickly to the window and got rid of his
burden and then, choking, his eyes streaming and
smarting, sprang across to Standart’s bed.</p>

<p>With vast relief, he found it empty, the clothes
huddled together. That was all right, then. Standart
was safe. But, back at the window a new fear
reached him. Perhaps he had not got out, after all!
Perhaps he was still somewhere in the house. He
certainly had not seen him. For a moment he hesitated.
Then he threw off the fear with a shrug of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
his shoulders. Standart had been awakened as soon
as any of them. It wasn’t likely that he would have
deliberately chosen to remain in the house. He put
a leg across the sill and again hesitated. Suppose
Standart was still in the room? He might be! He
might have become panic-stricken and fainted, just
as Mrs. Fair had done! Monty drew his foot back
and once more wound the towel across his mouth.
Then he dropped to his hands and knees, for the
smoke was too thick now for human endurance to
stand. As quickly as he could he made his way to
the door, his hand groping about in the darkness.
Nothing rewarded him. He groped back to the
alcove, choking, sputtering, his lungs aching, and
then across the room to his own bed. A sudden
crash of falling timbers and an accompanying flare
of crimson light brought him to his feet. But it was
only a wall below, and he dropped to his knees again.
His hand touched the doorsill and curiosity made
him reach up and turn the knob, and as he did so
the thought came to him that here was conclusive
evidence that Standart had gone out, for he remembered
leaving the door open after he had awakened
him. His search had been idle, after all. And
just then, as the latch was released, the door swung
inward against him as though of its own volition and
something toppled across the sill.</p>

<small>MONTY RECEIVES CALLERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Hi! There’s someone at a window around
there!”</p>

<p>The small junior dashed excitedly into
the group at the front of the burning house, his
voice shrill above the noise of the conflagration. A
dozen questions met him. The crowd thronged in
his wake.</p>

<p>“He’s up there!” shrilled the boy. “Where the
ladder is. Look! See him?”</p>

<p>“There’s two of them!” someone shouted.
“Help!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a fellow here to be carried down,” came
a voice from the window. “He’s unconscious. Send
a fireman, will you? It’s getting thick up here.”
The voice sounded faint and hoarse. Those below
could now make out two forms at the open casement,
one leaning out over the sill and the other lying
across it, his head hanging limply. Reassurance
came from a dozen throats and several fellows
dashed at top speed in search of assistance. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
a boy pushed his way to the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Monty?” he called anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t come up, Leon. It’s a job for a
fireman.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Standart,” croaked Monty. “I found him—in
the hall.”</p>

<p>“Standart!” echoed Leon wonderingly.</p>

<p>Two firemen brushed past him and began the
ascent, while the throng grew. “Easy, Jack! This
ladder’s weak from the feelin’. All right, feller!
We’ll take him in a sec! Ready, Jack? Here he
comes! Got him? Lower away. Good work,
kid! How’d you happen to be up here? Easy
now, Jack!”</p>

<p>They brought the unconscious form of Alvin
Standart cautiously down the ladder. Willing hands
accepted the burden as an anxious silence fell over
the crowd and bore it away. Then one of the firemen
sprang up the ladder again.</p>

<p>“Wait till I give you a hand, lad!” he called to
Monty.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, thanks,” was the answer. Monty
crawled across the sill, found the ladder with his
foot and began the descent. But he came very
slowly, pausing between each step, and after watching
a moment the fireman, who had paused halfway
up, hurried to meet him. “Give me your feet,” he
said. “Hold to the rungs with your hands and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
lower yourself slow. Jack, give us a hand up here.
This feller’s all in!”</p>

<p>“I can manage,” said Monty faintly. But the
fireman paid no heed to him. Instead, he was
plucked bodily in arms and handed from one to the
other and finally set on his feet on the turf.</p>

<p>“Thanks, partner,” he said. “The smoke got in
my——”</p>

<p>Then his legs crumpled up and he fell into Leon’s
arms.</p>

<p>Monty awoke some six hours later amidst strange
surroundings. A boy whom he knew only by
sight was standing across the room in front of a
chiffonier. There was a second bed near by. The
pictures on the gray paper were utterly unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Monty, conscious of being very tired and very sore
as to throat and lungs, tried to puzzle things out.
Before he had succeeded, however, the boy at the
chiffonier caught his bewildered look in the mirror
and turned.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he greeted. “Awake, Crail?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I—guess so.” Monty’s voice was hoarse
and croaky and it hurt him to speak. “Where am
I? Whose room is this?”</p>

<p>“Mine and Sawyer’s. I bunked with Sawyer after
the fire. How are you feeling?”</p>

<p>But Monty forgot to reply, for the word “fire”
had supplied the missing clue to memory. For a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
minute he was silent, going over the events of early
morning. At last: “What time is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ten of nine.”</p>

<p>“Oh! What—where—how’s Standart?”</p>

<p>“He’s over in Manning, in the infirmary. He’s
all right, I guess. Swallowed a lot of smoke, I
heard, and will be laid up for a few days, but I guess
he will back out all right. Lucky you found him,
Crail! It was a close squeak for him!”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Monty closed his eyes a moment, opened
them again and asked: “Have I had any breakfast?”
But there was no answer and he discovered
that the boy whose bed he was occupying had meanly
taken advantage of his momentary lapse from consciousness
to sneak out. Monty reflected that a cup
of coffee would be pretty fine, and he considered
getting up and finding one. But somehow, while he
was making up his mind to the necessary exertion, he
fell asleep again.</p>

<p>When he awoke the next time the breakfast was
there and a maid was summoning his attention to
the fact. It wasn’t a very hearty meal, but it did
him a lot of good. Still later the doctor came in
and asked him a number of questions and felt his
pulse and told him to stay in bed until the next day.
He left some tablets which Monty was instructed to
dissolve in his mouth and went his way. At various
times other persons put their heads in at the door or
entered for awhile; Mrs. Fair, and Brill, the owner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
of the bed, and Joe Mullins and four or five of the
Morris House fellows. And finally Leon came and
perched himself on the edge of the bed and talked
in whispers until Monty begged him to “cut out the
bedside manner.”</p>

<p>“What happened, anyway?” demanded Monty.
“Did the house burn up entirely?”</p>

<p>“No, they saved about half of it. Your room
and the rooms on that side are all right, except that
they’re horribly messy and smelly. By the way, we
found your suitcase and a lot of things you threw
out and they’re downstairs. They say they’re going
to pull Morris down entirely and put up a brick dormitory
there big enough to hold fifty fellows. They
had a wild time finding places to put the crowd.
Some of them slept in the gym. Standart’s in the
infirmary with his insides scorched and feeling pretty
mean, I reckon. I dare say you know that you’re a
sort of hero today, Monty.”</p>

<p>“Am I? No, I didn’t know it. I don’t feel
heroic,” he added croakingly. “Didn’t do anything
heroic, either. I went back up there to get some of
my things out and only came across Standart by
accident. Guess he’d fiddled around too long and
then had a fright when he tried to get out. Or else
the smoke was too much for him. Anyway, he
wasn’t saying anything when I found him. What
are you grinning at?”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking that it was sort of funny,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
laughed Leon. “You were going to knock him into
a cocked hat, and instead of that you saved his silly
life.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t do anything else, could I?” growled
Monty. “Couldn’t leave him there, naturally. Is
he bad?”</p>

<p>“N-no, he will be all right in a few days, they say.
Has a bit of fever now. Reckon he was scared more
than he was hurt. Say, you’re coming in with Seymour
and me tomorrow. I saw Rumford about it.
Lots of the fellows are doubling up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Monty vaguely. “I’m
kind of confused. I was going to back-trail,
today, wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>“No, you just thought you were,” replied Leon
carelessly. “Fate had a different plan, you see.”</p>

<p>“Fate, eh?” Monty considered that. “Well, I
don’t know. I suppose I might as well stick it out
now, though. My things are all sprinkled around
the landscape, I guess. Did the other fellows save
anything?”</p>

<p>“Some of them. Ordway told me to tell you he
was sorry and that you were to buck up, whatever
he meant. They say Manson’s going back on the
team, by the way.”</p>

<p>“He is? I wish he wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because—oh, just because. He’s not fit to play.
I suppose every one knows about me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>“Sure! And everyone’s talking about it. Didn’t
I tell you you were a hero?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that! I meant about being on probation.”</p>

<p>Leon shook his head slowly. “I don’t think anyone
knows it unless you’ve told.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well—” Monty stared thoughtfully at
the window. “I suppose a fellow can be on pro. and
still survive, eh? Say, I’ve been thinking of something,
Leon.”</p>

<p>“Honest? Did the doctor say you might?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking that it would be—well, sort
of fun to give the school a new dormitory. I can
afford to, you know. Of course, I wouldn’t do it
myself. I mean it would be my money, but I’d have
Jasper attend to it. I suppose it would look silly if
I did it myself.”</p>

<p>“Why would it? I think it would be great,
Monty! You could have them call it Crail Hall.
Do you really mean it?”</p>

<p>“Crail Hall nothing! It would be Morris, of
course. I guess if they got busy they could have it
ready for next fall, eh? Sure, I mean it, if they’ll
let me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll let you, all right,” laughed Leon. “I
reckon if you put it up to Charley he would fall on
your neck. Maybe he’d let you off probation, too!”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t say anything about it,” said Monty,
with a scowl. “I don’t want to buy myself off, you
silly ass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>“Well, don’t get mad about it. Say, Mr. Rumford’s
going to come over to see you this afternoon.
If I were you I’d be nice and polite to him, Monty.
He’s not a bad sort——”</p>

<p>“He needn’t,” said Monty grumpily. “Going?”</p>

<p>“Got to. Jimmy and Dud will be around some
time. I’ll drop in again after last hour, too. They
say you’ve got to stay here until tomorrow. Then
you’re coming over to Trow. I’m awfully glad,
Monty.”</p>

<p>“It’s decent of you and Granger,” Monty grinned.
“I won’t call him a spider again.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t mind,” replied Leon. “Besides,
he’s caught his fly now.”</p>

<p>“Fly?” questioned Monty.</p>

<p>“You,” laughed Leon from the door. “So long!”</p>

<p>After a meager dinner Monty secured reading
matter, propped the pillows behind him and strove
to make the best of his incarceration. In the middle
of the first story, however, Mr. Rumford was announced.
Monty never would tell what transpired
at that interview and so it would hardly be fair for
me to tell, but the results of it were no secret. When
Leon arrived about four Monty triumphantly informed
him that he was not on probation, after all,
that “Old Whiskers” was “a good Indian,” and no
one need say otherwise in his, Monty’s, hearing, and
that everything was fine and dandy. “And,” added
Monty, “it’s all right about the dormitory. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
mustn’t say anything about it to anyone, though, because
it’s a secret. It’s to be called Morris Hall
and no one is to know that I had anything to do with
it. Mr. Rumford is going to talk to Charley about
it right away, but he says he is sure the Whatyoucallthems—trustees—will
be tickled to death.”</p>

<p>“Did ‘Jimmy’ say that?” asked Leon innocently.</p>

<p>“Well, that was the idea of it. Say, Leon, do
you suppose Bonner will let me play Saturday? I’m
all right, you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not. You don’t have to give the
signals.”</p>

<p>“What has that got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only if you did no one could hear
them,” chuckled Leon. “You talk like a rusty windmill.”</p>

<p>“So would you if all the skin was off your throat.
Where are those tablet things? Don’t you think I
talk better than I did this morning?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” replied Leon flatly. “And if
you take my advice you’ll do less of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to take your advice, though, partner.
I didn’t do much talking when Jimmy and Dud were
here, anyway. Jimmy did it all. He had a fool
story about the fellows finding my underwear all
around the shop and keeping it as souvenirs. I wish
I could see Mr. Bonner.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you write him a note?” suggested
Leon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>“Guess I will. Find me a piece of paper and a
pen, will you? Isn’t there some on the table?
Thanks.” Monty propped himself higher and set
to work. It took some time to compose the four
lines that were finally evolved, and when he folded
the sheet and put it in an envelope he heaved a sigh
of relief. “There,” he said, “that ought to fetch
him. Will you post it for me, Leon? I haven’t a
stamp, but there’s some money somewhere if you can
find it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better than post it,” said Leon. “I’ll
hand it to him at supper. Now stop talking and rest
up. Better try to sleep about twelve hours tonight,
old chap.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right. You won’t forget the note, will
you? Manson oughtn’t to play Saturday, you
know.”</p>

<p>“But Monty Crail ought?” laughed Leon. “All
right. Don’t worry. I’ll see that the precious note
gets to Bonner by six o’clock.”</p>

<p>And Leon must have kept his promise, for at a
little before seven the coach was talking to Monty
across a devastated supper tray.</p>

<p class="cap">The big game took place at Greenbank that
year, and at a quarter to four two days later
the first half of the contest came to an end
with the score 7 to 6 in Mount Morris’s favor.
Perhaps one who held the fortunes of neither team
at heart would have voted that first half uninteresting
and none too well played, but to the five
hundred boys who cheered and sang and flaunted
banners from opposite sides of the field the
contest had been exciting from end to end, and
if there had been some poor playing, at least
it had been pretty equally shared by the contesting
elevens. An amazing deal of fumbling and
poor judgment had featured the first ten minutes,
and both teams had been guilty. Stage-fright had
affected everyone, it had seemed, and it was not until
a misjudged punt had gone over Nick Blake’s head
and been captured by a Mount Morris end on Grafton’s
twelve yards and then been worked across the
line for the first touchdown that either side pulled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
itself together. Mount Morris had converted the
resulting six points into seven by a well-aimed kick.
Against this handicap the Scarlet-and-Gray had
fought unavailingly until within six minutes of the
end of the second period. Then Fortune had, in
turn, smiled on the visitors.</p>

<p>A long forward-pass by Mount Morris had been
captured by Milford, playing at right end, and Milford
had dodged and feinted his way past the whole
green-and-white team and would have scored then
and there had he not slipped on a none too dry turf
and been pounced on by a pursuing enemy some eight
yards from the last line. But that only stayed the
touchdown for a few minutes, for Grafton had no
idea of being stopped virtually on the threshold.
Winslow and Ordway and then Monty had each
sliced off his share of the remaining distance, and
then Winslow, skirting left tackle, had gone rolling
across the final mark. But the captain had made a
mess of his goal-try and when, a minute or two later,
the whistle had blown, Mount Morris had trotted
off with one point to her advantage.</p>

<p>During half-time the spectators pulled their collars
up around the necks and plunged chilled fingers into
pockets and stamped numb feet, for the afternoon
was gray and cold. Earlier, there had been one or
two brief glimpses of the sun and a pale yellow radiance
had promised warmth, but the promise had
not been fulfilled. There was a light but chilling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
breeze from the northwest that stole searchingly up
sleeves and down unprotected necks. Grafton and
Mount Morris adherents sang their songs and
cheered lustily while they awaited the reappearance
of the teams and managed occasionally to forget
their discomfort. But the time went slowly, as it
always does when a close score has made the next
half-hour of play so vitally important, and it seemed
much more than a quarter of an hour before the
blanketed teams reappeared and the cheer leaders
dashed to the front of the stands and waved their
arms. Then the last sustained “Grafton!” died
away and the voice of the referee came distinctly
from the field.</p>

<p>“Ready, Grafton? Ready, Mount Morris?”</p>

<p>Then came the whistle, a moment of waiting and
the ball arched away from Pete Gowen’s boot.</p>

<p>Monty watched now from the bench, for they had
given his place to Caner. Why this was so Monty
couldn’t fathom. He was sensible of having conducted
himself at least worthily. He didn’t have
to accept his own judgment only as to that, for in
the little bleak shed in which they had spent the intermission
more than one fellow had told him as
much; not in words, to be sure, but in approving
thumps and looks that meant more than words.
Monty had been roughly used in those first two quarters,
for Mount Morris was out to win, and gentleness
was no part of her method, but his injuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
were not important and most of them were in plain
sight in the shape of a swollen left eye and a two-inch
cut on his chin, the latter chastely hidden by a
strip of plaster. However, there was no use in
whining. Caner had the job and Caner was doing
it well. Monty strove to be philosophical and snuggled
his hands into his sweater sleeves and hunched
the red blanket more closely about him and watched
every play with his heart almost in his mouth. When
you have taken part in a game it is hard to be relegated
to the rôle of looker-on. You see so many
things happen that, you are firmly convinced, could
not have happened had you been in there! As when
Ordway, running the left end, was brought thumping
to earth for a six-yard loss because the interference
had straggled. Or as when Caner, trying a straight
plunge from kick formation, which had fooled no
one for an instant, had chosen the wrong hole and
been brought up standing and pushed back and back!</p>

<p>Monty could only hope that Caner, without being
badly hurt, would be put out of it before the game
was over. Even then, however, he reflected
morosely, it might be Fenton who would pull his
head harness on and go loping into the line-up.</p>

<p>Mount Morris put a scare into the hearts of Graftonians
in the third quarter by working the ball
steadily up the field by end runs and tackle plays interspersed
with three successful forward-passes as
far as the visitor’s eighteen. There, though, Grafton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
met the succeeding onslaught heroically and,
while retreating to her twelve yards, finally forced
the enemy to try a place-kick. That Mount Morris
did not by that means add another three points to
her seven was only because her line did not hold.
The ball started true enough, but someone’s canvas-clad
chest got in its way and Nick Blake fell on
the pigskin far back up the field and for the time
danger was averted. A minute or two later Weston
replaced Blake and Hanser went in for Ordway.
The result of Weston’s substitution was at once apparent,
for Grafton started to kick in the endeavor
to reach a point from which Winslow might lift a
field-goal over the bar and so forge ahead. And
Grafton gained slightly on each exchange, for Mount
Morris accepted the challenge and punted back regularly
on third down, but the gains came slowly and
time was flying and almost before anyone expected
it the quarter was up.</p>

<p>It was Grafton’s ball then on her own forty-five-yard
line, Hanser having just reeled off five yards
through left guard with the rest of the Grafton
backfield piling through on his heels. The teams
changed positions and Hanser again banged at the
Mount Morris left and got a scant two. Winslow
punted on the next down and Mount Morris made
a fair catch—she was taking no chances of fumbling—on
her twenty-two. Two tries at the line netted
six yards and again the ball was in air. Winslow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
caught on his forty-seven and rushed to the enemy’s
forty-six. A yard by Caner made it second down
and Hanser got seven around the left end on a delayed
pass. Weston punted from close up and the
ball went out at the opponent’s twenty-one. Then
Mount Morris faked a forward and sent a back
circling around Derry’s end and gained nearly her
distance. A forward-pass grounded and she punted
to Grafton’s thirty. Weston fumbled the catch, but
recovered before he was tackled. Caner went back
and tried a forward to Milford that grounded.
Winslow smashed off three at right tackle but fumbled,
Weston recovering for a loss of seven yards.
Winslow punted.</p>

<p>Mount Morris ran back for a dozen yards before
she was stopped and time was called for Grafton.
Hanrihan was hurt and made way for Gordon. The
timer announced nine minutes left. Two attempts
at the Grafton line failed and Mount Morris punted
to Grafton’s twelve. Weston missed the catch, but
Hanser recovered it and gained a few yards before
he was thrown. Blake replaced Weston. Winslow
got free around the right side and ran to the thirty-two.
On a fake-kick he again gained, getting six
through center. Caner added four more and made
it first down on the forty-two yards. Caner got
three through center and Blake ran the right end for
three more. Winslow was stopped for no gain and
punted to the enemy’s ten yards, a kick that brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
a roar of applause from the Grafton side. The
Mount Morris quarter signaled a fair-catch, but
muffed the ball and finally fell on it just inside the
goal line. Mount Morris kicked on first down from
behind her goal and Blake caught on the thirty-seven
and was downed for no gain. There were six minutes
left. Longley replaced Musgrave at center and
Derry went back at left end. Grafton was cheering
imploringly, incessantly now.</p>

<p>Winslow tried to find a hole at right guard, but
was stopped, and Hanser had no better luck on the
other side. Winslow went back to kicking position
and launched a lateral pass to Derry and the end got
eight yards straight along the side line. From kick
formation Blake dived through for first down. On
this play Winslow was injured and Boynton was sent
in. Mount Morris also made changes. The home
team was plainly on the defensive now and showing
weakness. Boynton tried to run the left end and
was downed behind his line. Caner got four through
the line, but off-side was called and Grafton took her
third penalty of the game. Hanser sent a forward
to Derry and gained the distance. Hersum went in
for Kinley at guard.</p>

<p>The ball was now near Mount Morris’s eighteen
yards and close to the right side of the field. Hanser
and Caner failed to gain and Boynton took the ball
on an end run and gained four yards, placing the
pigskin on the enemy’s fourteen yards and in front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
of her goal. Mount Morris called time for an injury
and Blake conferred with Derry, acting captain.</p>

<p>At that moment Monty, absorbed in anxious
speculation as to the next play, felt a hand on his
shoulder. “Come on, Crail,” said Coach Bonner,
and Monty followed the latter along the line. “Do
you know who gave you that eye?” he asked.</p>

<p>Monty nodded. “Their left guard, sir.”</p>

<p>“He’s still in there, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Think you could get through him if you had the
chance?”</p>

<p>“I know it,” replied Monty grimly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonner clapped him on the back. “Go
ahead then,” he said. “Tell Blake not to kick.
Tell him we want a touchdown. Tell him to use
the three-abreast formation and <em>hammer that
guard</em>!”</p>

<p>Only fourteen to go and a good three minutes left!
Monty ran in with his message to Nick Blake and
took Caner’s head-guard from that player’s unwilling
hand. Then he went back to position and
awaited the whistle and the signal, and as he waited
he fixed a speculative eye on the Mount Morris left
guard. That player glared back from a disfigured
countenance and Monty smiled secretly and trod the
half-frozen sod to limber his legs. And then Mount
Morris, having used her full allowance of time,
formed her line again, and Blake looked around at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
his backs and cried “Formation B! Signal!” and
Monty fell in between Hanser and Boynton and
crouched.</p>

<p>Then he sprang ahead and Blake clapped the ball
against his stomach and he smashed straight into
that guard position and went on ripping and tearing
through, yard after yard, until arms at his neck and
arms gripping his legs and arms tugging at his waist
brought him to a stop and he grunted “<em>Down</em>,” and
let them push him back.</p>

<p>There was one anxious moment, with the official,
astride the ball, peering through the early twilight
toward the linesman’s upraised hand. Then came
the verdict, curt, decisive: “First down! About
seven to go!”</p>

<p>Monty’s heart thumped triumphantly. He had
gained a good six! And he had gained it through
that left guard position! He went panting back
to his place again, his face lighted with a huge
smile.</p>

<p>He wondered if Blake would let him try it again.
He knew he could do it. There was never a doubt
in his mind as to that. And something told him
that that green-and-white stockinged left guard knew
it, too! But Blake didn’t know it, and Blake slapped
the ball at Boynton, and Boynton, crossing the backfield,
slammed past tackle for a scant yard. And
Mount Morris shouted hoarsely in defiance. The
timekeeper was edging in, step by step, his gaze alternating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
from watch dial to players. Monty hated
him intensely.</p>

<p>Blake was begging them to hurry.</p>

<p>“Come on now, Grafton! Let’s put it over!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Signals!”</p>

<p>Then Monty’s heart leaped, for the ball was his
again. He felt it jam against his stomach, clutched
his hands across it and slammed ahead. The hole
was not there this time.</p>

<p>He struck fairly into that left guard and felt his
bones rattle. But he meant to get through and he
was going through, and he put all his strength into
his pushing legs and all his weight into his straining
body and the mass about him gave before him or
followed after. A yard, half a yard, a foot, another
foot, an inch or so——</p>

<p>All about him the sound of rasping canvas, of
stertorous breaths, of inarticulate cries, a welter of
heaving bodies, of grasping arms! And then, suddenly,
he was looking straight into the face of that
left guard from the distance of six inches, and the
face was despairing! And Monty called on every
last ounce of strength and felt his heart swell with
the effort and his muscles creak. And the face in
front of him passed aside, the eyes very wide and
troubled, and Monty’s legs found a stride that they
had despaired of and he went on again, at first slowly
and then with a sudden rush, and at last, stumbling
and falling, he crashed against a canvas-padded post,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
caromed off it, measured his length on the turf and
felt the jar of bodies plunging down upon him and
smiled contentedly because the ball was still clutched
safely in his arms and he knew that Grafton had
won!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
